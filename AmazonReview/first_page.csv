Mohsin Bhatti,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome value for money.,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2019,"<span>one of the best mobile under this price. This phone is awesome. I have 5 start. to light weight, great feature, photo quality with ultra wide angel, micro &amp; 64 megapixel is awesome. I so lucky I got this phone on First sale with 10% discount. After using more than 3 weeks, I didn't find any issue. Battery backup is awesome, I usually charge only one time in day. after heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, call of duty, videos and watching online movies, still Battery backup good. Liquid cooling technology is good, after playing PUBG continually more than 2 hours, mobile little bit heat. but just rest of 3 or  5 minute, mobile get cool. Overall this phone is awesome which give separate nano sim support means we can insert two sim in different slot.</span>",272 people found this helpful

Abhiishek Mohta,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the MediaTek G90T gaming processor.,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2019,"<span>Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:<br><br>6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Camera<br><br>This is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there‚Äôs a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, battery<br><br>Games like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.<br><br>The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.<br><br>The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, Display<br><br>The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.<br><br>The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.<br><br>The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.</span>",

Bhushan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mid Range Beast | Flagship Gaming Experience,Reviewed in India on 7 November 2019,"<span>Read this review, if Planning to buy Redmi Note 8 Pro.<br><br>Bought Redmi Note 8 Pro in first sale, using it extensively, pretty satisfied with overall experience so far.<br><br>Battery: 5/5<br>Performance: 5/5<br>Display: 4/5<br>Camera: 5/5<br><br>#Pro's:<br>1. Superb Gaming performance<br>2. Multitasking is smooth.<br>3. Liquid cooling system which cools down your device &amp; device doesn't get heated even while gaming.<br>4. Amazing camera.<br>5. Alexa support, which is first time available on any mobile.<br>6. Dedicated SD card slot.<br>7. P2i coating to save device from water splashes.<br>8. Gorilla glass 5 on front as well as on back.<br>9. 18 watt charger inside box.<br>10. IR Blaster.<br>11. Notification led.<br>12. Headphone jack is still there.<br>13. Fingerprint sensor is placed little too high but it faster than usual in display fingerprint sensors.<br><br>#Con's:<br>1. No AMOLED display.  :(<br>2. No in-display fingerprint sensor.<br>3. Mediatek processor: If you are advance user &amp; into rooting, customization, then only it will affect you. Otherwise, no need to worry.<br><br>@PERFORMANCE:<br>- Note 8 Pro comes with Helio G90T mediatek cheapset which having mediatek hyper engine that is well optimized for gaming, also it offers Game Turbo mode. So, gaming experience is best on this device.<br>Tried PUBG, COD in high settings, it was lag free without any frame drops.<br>- In Antutu Benchmark test, Helio G90T scores much better than Snapdragon 712.<br><br>@BATTERY:<br>- 4500 mAh of Battery gets fully charged in approx 2 hrs with 18 w charger (which comes inside box), with moderate usage, it easily lasts for more than a day.<br><br>@CAMERA:<br>- 64 MP Quad cam captures amazing portraits.

It also provides 960fps Slo-mo recording feature.<br><br>VERDICT:<br>Overall, Redmi Note 8 Pro is best device in 15k price segment offering many features which competitors don't offer. If your main priority is Gaming, Performance, Camera then definitely go for Redmi Note 8.<br>Or<br>If AMOLED Display, in display fingerprint sensor is your priority then go for Realme XT.<br><br>Will update review after using few more weeks.</span>",67 people found this helpful

Afzal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good Phone with nice camera and specs! But No support for Data Transfer,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2019,"<span>Glad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.<br>The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.<br>It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!<br><br>Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!<br><br>About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data.<br><br>Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!<br><br>All in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don't want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn't work!</span>",

Dr. Sumit,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total Crap. ..,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2019,"<span>Well, I was waiting long for this mobile, but when I received it my dreams were shattered. On the very first sale in bought this mobile. When I removed the tampered  (plastic covering screen ) there were scratches on the screen. I wonder what happened to the control check of xiaomi? How can they so carelessly sell the mobile without proper inspection? This reflects how customer oriented they are! About the phone functioning I cannot comment any thing as I did not use it more than 20 minutes . But one thing is for sure, if things are sold without proper  inspection and quality check, what being a customer we receive is going to be a ""CRAP"".</span>",45 people found this helpful

Abhishek P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect value for money,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2019,"<span>Been using the phone for 2 weeks and it's safe to say that it's worth your money. Performance being the strong point is top notch..no complaints here. Even the display being IPS is great too.Design is sleek and premium unlike previous redmi phones. For the temps it definitely heats (which the the primary concern since the day it was announced)...but its not an issue,definitely not...at least not in my unit and it is cool and stable when not gaming. What my concern was it's battery ,maybe the g90t is power hungry and 4500mah lasts almost a day..I wished it to last for the next half too. I hope redmi fix in an ota update ü§û, the 18watt charger comes as a life saver here, it was a must and thanks redmi for providing it in the box.<br>....will update this review in the future after long term use....<br>Is this phone worth your money üí∞-YES...</span>",

Rajesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Heating up problem. Mediatech processor.,Reviewed in India on 7 November 2019,<span>Phone get heated up in simple 30/40 minutes of simple game playing. It seems  Xiaomi has compromised in this segment  by lowering the price in comparision with realme XT. I highly recommend not to buy the phone if you can't tolerate the heating issue. Sometimes it's temperature go beyond 50 degree Celsius. This is the major draw back of redmi note 8 pro. Those who like to play game should remain away from this phone. Claim of Xiaomi is not upto the mark. Rest is ok.  Its upto you.</span>,

Sarkhazi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Redmi Note 8 Pro (Shadow Black, 6GB | 64GB) - A Camera Beast - Gaming Powerhouse",Reviewed in India on 8 November 2019,"<span>Redmi Note 8 Pro<br><br>DESIGN  -  Solid and Well built, Front &amp; back Gorilla Glass 5 protection with curved edges. The camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on, may be a matter of concern. Please look for a Silicon cover to protect the camera module.<br><br>PROCESSOR  -  This houses the newest chipset from MediaTek Helio G90T which is basically designed for gaming. This not only helps the phone to load &amp; play high graphic intensive games fast &amp; smooth, but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of Apps in a day to day usage. The overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery. Those who are complaining of heating issues, should buy ACs before buying phones for playing games for hours..<br><br>STORAGE &amp; RAM  -  This comes with the fast UFS 2.1 onboard storage that help load apps ultra-fast, as compare to old eMMC 5.1 type storage. The basic model starts with 6 GB LPDDR4 RAM with Dual Channel Enabled. This helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel RAM. Everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such.<br>Supports up to a whopping 512 GB of storage with a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. This is what we want in every phone‚Ä¶<br><br>DISPLAY  -  6.53‚Äù IPS LCD Panel with 395 PPI density and 2.5D curved edges. This display is of a 1080 x 2340 Resolution with HDR Enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life. The water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings. Personally, to me the display looked very crisp and sharp. The brightness of this display can go up to 430nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp‚Ä¶ 4k HDR video quality on YouTube is amazing on this display...<br><br>CAMERA  -  This is where it exceeds all other phones. The default 12 MP Camera takes nice pictures in all modes. The 64 MP mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast. The pictures with 64 MP camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details. But the image size for 64 MP camera would be approximately around 15 MB per picture. This can record the videos up to 4k Resolution. However, Full HD videos will have an Electronic Stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos. Macros also come very crisp considering that this is a Mobile camera but, not the DSLR.<br>Front 20 MP Camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail. This can record videos up to Full HD resolution. This phone does a great job in Camera department. This will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures‚Ä¶<br>Those who are looking for Gcam support, should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone. The company has offered a good package with great camera and it does a wonderful job. People who are looking for an astonishing clarity Camera then they should look for a DSLRs or buy flagship phones.<br>Attaching few pictures for reference‚Ä¶<br><br>CONNECTIVITY  -  Supports Dual 4G VoLTE on both SIM Cards simultaneously. Dual Band Wi-Fi that increases both Upload and Download speeds dramatically if connected to Wi-Fi 5GHz connection.<br>Comes with Bluetooth 5 with LE (Low Energy) mode on that helps preserve battery drain..<br><br>BATTERY  -  A Whopping 4500 mAh Battery with Quick Charge support.<br><br>VERDICT  -  One Word ‚Äì A Monster in all aspects, be it a Design, Style, Battery, Display and Camera. Except its weight of 200Gms, this is one piece of art and technology that nobody wants to miss having it‚Ä¶<br>Every product will have their own issues and bugs, including flagships that can be fixed with a software update.  And every product cannot be compared with another since everything has its own existence and importance.<br><br>Thanks to Amazon for safe packaging and fast delivery‚Ä¶</span>",

PUBG- pubg lovers if you want a phone specially for pubg dont let thsis phone go .excellent gaming<br>5. heating issue?- only if you use this phone for long time with continous gaming.and with high graphics. otherwise no issue even you watch a full movie with wifi. only while gaming after one hour on full hd graphics<br>6. display- butter smooth display quit large and excellent display best in claass but will not produce colours as super amoled just a littel bit of diferrence between the two  but you will not find much differance in day to day life . so full marks for display<br>7. battery- i will say a decent battery life considering 6.5 inch display and a a heavy processor<br>camera?- this is the biggest of alll and i am giving you a detailed review for this. camera is superb no doubt even in low light it performes vary well and after zooming the photos you will not get blur images at all. potrait mode is one of the best in this segments .<br>but now the cons of camera<br>slow motion and wide camera are poor. vary poor quality i am not impressed at all. slow motion video you can capture only from short or close distance otherwise not good at all and even you cant shoot in artificial lights is well. and wide camera does not produces good quality pictures. macro camera is excellent.<br>and the last con of camera i compaired this camera with iphone xr and vivo v15pro . in terms of details it is totally equall to them but colours of the pics is not that great but decent in comaprison you will find colours bitt dull but that does not mean they are better . they only produces better colour otherwise same. but one thing to notice both iphone and vivo captures the colour more saturated than orignal even they dont produces real colours. redmi shows littel light colours than real and xr iphone and vivo littel dark than orignal .camera is vary good and you will get good pictures and for colour you can adjust them with some photo editing. so no issues. final verdict on camera is .that it is a good camera and you will not be disspointed<br>worth the money you spend<br>great display good camera good battery good built quality<br>littel heavy, sound lacks dolby quality.camera slow motion and wide angel not good<br>i will say only compititor for this phone is Vivo z1x in this price segment.<br>you can buy any of this phone depends on your demands</span>",20 people found this helpful

Upside 1st wide camera(8MP), is not at all used in camera app. Goto Pro in camera app, and select wide lens option.It's using 64mp camera instead of 8MP camera lens. In camera app, 8MP camera not at all used in any mode. Anyone can check by putting fingure on camera, with different different camera lens mode. Xiaomi making foolish by putting many cameras. If single camera can be used with all the options then why added these cameras.<br><br>Some heating issue in phone, I'm ok with it.

To be frank redmi is the phone known for ""TECHNOLOGY AT AFFORDABLE COST"".<br>Pros:<br>1)The phone's performance is top notch<br>2) The camera is considerably good. You can't expect much of pro pics even though they mention it as 64mp .<br>3) The design is Ultimate. It's like competing with One plus 7 pro. It's resemble merely like a premium brand phones. The electric Blue is lit.<br>4) Overall the phone is best for it's speedy and glassy and classy performance.<br><br>Cons :<br>1) If you're considering this phone for your privacy and banking purpose it is not at all advisable. There are a lot of advertisement and access to third parties. It is merely easily accessible by any third parties which envisages them to pop advertisement for us.<br><br>2) The screen quality is OK as it is LCD. Now it's the era a of AMOLED displays.<br><br>3) Heating is considerably fine .<br><br>4) Prone for camera scratch so use a good back cover .</span>",

Once screen is off you can't wake the screen by pressing on button or double tap or through finger print sensor. Screen only activates once the call is disconnected by other person. Due to this we cannot make calls to IVR as we don't get screen to select options<br><br>b) Finger print sensor does not work if you are activating phone after 2 to 3 hours, once you have activated using on button then onwards finger print sensor will respond<br><br>c) Some of the text in widgets some.up in Chinese when all other text is in English.<br><br>d) had experienced lag prior to installing updates<br><br>Except above 4 issues this is an excellent phone.</span>",

Bhavesh assudani,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone ever #redmi #mi,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2019,"<span>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is an upgrade over the Note 7 Pro in almost every count. At least on paper. In the real world, there is a boost in gaming performance and display quality while the added Alexa integration will be welcomed by some. The camera quality remains more or less the same despite a newer sensor, and that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. Addressing a few burning issues, we initially concluded the Note 8 Pro might be overheating during longer gaming sessions. While the phone does run warmer than say the Realme 5 Pro, it doesn‚Äôt go beyond 50 degrees, which is what we consider overheating in smartphones. The battery life of the phone is just as good as its predecessor, despite a larger battery. By the looks of it, Xiaomi took a bold step by choosing to go with a MediaTek flagship SoC and it seems to have paid off. There‚Äôs no reason why shouldn‚Äôt buy the Redmi Note 8 Pro, save for the pesky ads in the UI.<br>#redmi #mi</span>",6 people found this helpful

It highlights every spot on your face n even the sweat n oil though you smoothen the pics. Beautify option is not good as 5pro or 6 pro. Battery dries out very soon n takes too much time to change.. i was using Redmi note 5 pro.. that Phone' battery life is better than this phone.. Too many adds in every app, no option to shut them. Phone is quite heavy, it's definitely not for people with small palms.the cover provided with phone is pathetic, does not cover camera very well unlike the cover provided with 5 pro. One drop &amp; camera glass willl break for sure.. Good for gaming.. pubg runs very smooth and graphics looks amazing..but it drains the battery in 2 games.. in previous version we had finger touch option for taking pics. We do not have that option in this phone.</span>",6 people found this helpful

Then I dialed from my wife mobile only then understood even though my phone shows I attended the call but it's still ringing on callers side.

SRS Exclusives,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed first time ever in 5 Years from Xiaomi,Reviewed in India on 19 January 2020,"<span>First time ever this smartphone from Xiaomi disappointed me as I was a Xiaomi fan since second smartphone from Xiaomi that is Redmi 1S launched in India. After 1S I had used many Xiaomi smartphones from Redmi Note 3, Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 5, Redmi 2 Prime, Mi 4i, Mi A2, Poco F1, Redmi Note 7, Redmi Note 7 Pro and Mi 5. But first time ever I am disappointed with any Xiaomi smartphone and that phone is none other than Redmi Note 8 Pro. I had even visited Redmi Note 8 Pro launch event and there they showcased this smartphone that good that I wanted to purchase it. So finally I did buy the phone thinking about all these features like cooling pipe, gaming-centric smartphone and all. But finally, after spending that much money it was all worthless as the phone screen was not that good buying it for Rs 15K. Ignoring the screen camera was disgusting. And most importantly phone was getting heated as well while playing PUBG only for about 30 minutes which is disgusting to spend this much and getting nothing. And the most disgusting was that I had gone with the Halo White color which does looks shabby and cheap smartphone without cover. So either covers it forever or use it hiding with everyone.<br>Last words never go for this smartphone ever. This was disgust phone ever which looked shabby, bulky and overpriced.</span>",4 people found this helpful

Yash-Delhi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Total value for money,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2019,"<span>Bought recently, using for few days now. Sharing initial impressions for assistance:<br>*Screen quality is really good, i have been using amoleds but not disappointed with this lcd, blacks are very good for lcd even thought the contrast ratio mentioned is around 13k but totally satisfied with the contrast, colors etc. It even out shined my older samsung a9 pro with its hdr videos in you tube.<br>*Gaming is good, played asphalt 9 for few hours at max settings and did not find much lags and the game is enjoyable without much heating either.<br>*Battery standby is v.good - no loss in standby even in night, not even 1%, even thought the screen &amp; android consumes a bit more battery than desired but still its nice and fast charging is also fine.<br>*Built quality is super - got white color and loved it, i wanted green but couldn't get that in sale so have to buy white but have to say it is very good. I love the curves in the side which makes handling a pleasure &amp; use big phones so i needed big size and could have gone for bigger also but not disappointed with this size also, pretty good. The weight is also ideal with not more than 200 which doesn't feel heavy.<br>*Finger print is fast and face is reliable and fast without opening in eyes closed case.<br>*UI is fast and filled with customization, i downloaded poco launcher instantly as i needed app drawer and its great.<br>*Both cameras are ok in indoor lighting not very great as i could not use it outdoors yet.<br>Thanks xiaomi for this great product and such price and thanks amazon for getting the same in just 2 days time without any extra charges.</span>",3 people found this helpful

BK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Redmi Note 8 Pro : Your Typical Redmi Note Gets A Premium Makeover,Reviewed in India on 7 November 2019,"<span>1)Thus, the Redmi Note 8 Pro happens to be Xiaomi's first smartphone with a 64MP Samsung sensor, a 'gaming-oriented' MediaTek Helio G90T chipset powering the device instead of the usual Qualcomm mid-range chipset, and a battery unit that has been increased to 4500mAh.<br><br>2)That said, the rivalry between Xiaomi and Realme has picked up frantic pace over the course of 2019, with both companies trying to outpace the other at every step. Having been the brand that has stood at the summit of India's smartphone market for eight straight quarters, the company certainly doesn't want to lose out relative newbies.<br><br>3)Realme, meanwhile, is breaking records of its own, gaining a market share of 9% within just 15 months of existence. So does the Redmi Note 8 Pro do enough to warrant the spotlight for yet another iteration? Read on to find out.<br>,Build and Design<br><br>4)The Redmi Note 8 Pro is hands-down the most attractive looking Redmi Note series phone till date. It's striking but not over the top and that's precisely why I've loved how Xiaomi's gone about the design here. It's also worth noting that Xiaomi's typically been a brand that doesn't revise their product designs often enough. They changed that with the Redmi Note 7 Pro earlier this year and eight months down the line, they've changed it up again: this time, adding it a little more oomph to the mix.<br><br>A Good Display That Could Have Been Better<br><br>On the front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro gets a 6.53-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel. The screen itself is seemingly identical to what Xiaomi fielded in this segment earlier this year, and you get decent colors and zero issues with sunlight legibility. But when you pay attention to competition though, namely, the Realme XT, you do get an AMOLED screen that has more vibrant colors.<br><br>The reason why the comparison between LCD and OLED comes up every time is because black levels and contrast aren‚Äôt exactly as good on an LCD panel as the AMOLED screen on the Realme XT. However, the difference in quality isn‚Äôt huge either. The panel on the Redmi Note 8 Pro is just as good as LCD panels get and if you're someone who streams a ton of video content on your phone, you'll definitely have a great experience.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro: Performance and Software<br><br>Xiaomi definitely raised eyebrows when they decided to go with a Mediatek SoC in the Note 8 Pro despite the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 doing an excellent job in the Redmi Note 7 Pro. In fact, it was a big risk and the scales could have tipped either way. But as it turns out, this was a brilliant decision on Xiaomi‚Äôs part as the Mediatek Helio G90T delivers every ounce of muscle you'd expect from it and more. This is by far the most powerful on any phone priced under INR 17-18,000, one that certainly caters to all the PUBG-walas out there.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro: You Didn't Need To Throw In Four Cameras In There Xiaomi<br><br>Rear:<br><br>64MP f/1.79 Primary<br>8MP f/2.2 Ultra-wide angle lens<br>2MP Macro Lens with focus upto 2cm<br>2MP depth sensor<br><br>Front: 20MP f/2.0 Selfie shooter</span>",5 people found this helpful

No calls attended, no gaming, used data for just updating apps and installation. I would say my usage is below average and still i am facing this issue. Even I do have redmi note 7 pro bought from flipkart and it's been 1 year and the performance and battery backup is better than this. Watching cricket on hotstar, took 5 calls for 2, 3 hrs long and still it has 65% battery. I am sure this is a defective product and customer care doesn't care ....I called them 3 times and they told me to perform battery calibration test I did that and already factory data rest and clear the caches still it is draining way too fast. They have provided me a defective piece and not letting me return or replace. On asking they told me that they have to follow procedure and will send technician and he will not be available till 27. I asked them to speak to their supervisor and as expected I was told that all the seniors are busy right now. Very dissappointed with amazon. I need my refund.</span>",5 people found this helpful

sandeep bansal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best midrange smartphone:Period!!!,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2019,"<span>I usually don't review products on Amazon, but this one deserves special mention; so here we go..<br>In the Box: You get handset, 18 Watt fast Charger, and a Cover, no screen guard inside the box...<br><br>The cover: deserves an especial mention- it's similar to OnePlus 7 cover and has that USB flap to protect phone from water damage...<br><br>The Handset: White looks almost magical; there are 2 trays side by side, which can accommodate 2 sims and a MicroSD. On the top, you will find an IR blaster, nothing new if you are a returning Xiaomi customer, but if this is your first, then just use it once and see how handy it is in controlling TV, AC and other remote control appliances...<br>Bottom has a single speaker grill, 3.5mm Jack and USB Type-C...<br><br>Switching On: It gives a haptic feedback which is quite tuned rather than the rude vibration that Redmi Note 5 pro gives, Xiaomi has worked hard to fine tune the device and it has paid well. Now starts the real torment: There are tons of options guiding you to customize the phone as you prepare for our maiden voyage and options for Ads are kinda well hidden, but more about it later.<br><br>UI: Now let your eyes and mind get accustomed to MIUI; there's no app drawer and all apps are neatly grouped into folders. there's a lot of bloat, but thank the sweet Lord it's uninstallable. I would advise you to enable developer options and reduce the animations to 0.5X; the phone will be noticeably faster and less animated...<br><br>Display: The HDR display is vibrant and bezels are negligible; one of the best ever seen on Redmi Note series...<br><br>Camera: Of course, it's the camera phone with monstrous 64MP primary sensor; my initial impressions were good but camera tends to saturate dark colors quite a bit, and Wide Angle has quite noticeable distortion; Scared yet? Don't be cuz even after these caveats, the camera performs well specially with pro-mode; do not use 64 MP mode, the noise increases quite a bit...<br><br>GCam: Here's our sweet savior again; Xiaomi has left Camera 2 api enabled, so installing GCam is pretty easy; right now, the best one has been developed by Wyroczen and you can find all about it by a single Google search; the GCam corrects most errors of he camera but do not use macro mode; it's much better on stock Camera...<br><br>Speakers: The single speaker doesn't really satisfy people who've used Stereo speakers, but this fact can't take away the limelight off Note 8 pro; the speaker is loud, crisp and has a good bass due to bigger cavity...<br><br>Connectivity: It is quite good and works fine; haven't seen 4G+ or carrier aggregation though...<br><br>Verdict: Redmi Note 8 Pro is a fine phone with little to compromise upon; Surely a great effort from Xiaomi once again...<br>PS: Pardon any typos.</span>",4 people found this helpful

Vipul,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst decision,Reviewed in India on 18 January 2020,"<span>From the day we bought this phone, there were a lot of problems such as call disconnects and sensor issues. I had to visit service center multiple times for over 1 and half month to get my phone replaced finally. The same issue came up with the replacement mobile. The service center guys are really rude now saying we can't do anything. I had to sell my phone after 2 and half months for a loss of over 7k. This is the worst decision I've ever made. The network quality is very low and the calls drop very frequently and the service is very very bad</span>",3 people found this helpful

Uday Singh,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great budget phone for Manual Photography and Gaming,Reviewed in India on 31 January 2020,"<span>Here's my full and honest review for those who wanna buy it:<br><br>It's kind of hard to get the features it gives in such a small price range. It surpasses most phones in similar price range, for following reasons:<br><br>1. The CPU. Even though it uses Mediatek chip (which is cheap and inferior to Snapdragons), it runs all of its 8 cores on stable 2GHz, not like others which have 2 cores running at 2.5GHz and rest of the 6 are at 1.5. Better buy the 8GB RAM version to get the most out of it, because This Mediatek chip somehow performs at par (or even better) than Snapdragon processors that come within the similar price range. However, it doesn't always run at full speed, but only when needed. This gives some problems like occasional lags when quickly opening high-memory apps while phone is in calm mode for too long.<br><br>2. Liquid cooled: Again, for this price range it's amazing. However, you need to keep the phone covered with plastic case (comes in the box) to make it work flawlessly. It's because the heat from your hands can easily get transferred to the inside fluid and interfere with convection currents that keep the phone cool. Using a plastic cover helps insulate it.<br><br>3. Multiple Antennae: The 3G/4G cellular reception on this phone is so good that you're practically never out of signal in the areas where most people struggle to get a single bar. Although it's aimed for gamers who need stable connection for online gaming, it's a big boon for everything else. Wifi/Hotspot works way better than any other phone.<br><br>4. Large battery, Out-of-Box Fast Charger and USB type C: Again, for a phone this cheap, it's a steal. Battery lasts VERY long because they didn't just pump this phone with fast CPU and large battery, but the way this phone handles everything is actually very efficient that gives you smooth experience while keeping the battery running for long. There are some noticeable glitches though, like sometimes phone takes a while to go from battery-saving to full performing mode and that creates lags. But thankfully, those lags aren't uncommon even in most expensive android phones, so for this small price, you should live with it. Because your other option for total zero lag free experience would be to spend 10x money and buy the iPhone 11, and once Apple releases new iOS, that will start lagging too.<br><br>5.  Cameras: This phone has 5 total cameras. While most of them weren't necessary and are uselessly overhyped, the main reasons to buy this are:<br>  a.) The color/contrast you get in the final clicked picture of 16MP that combines the data from multiple sensors - this is unmatched and you'll love the pictures shot in regular photo mode.<br>  b.) The pro mode with manual controls (32-sec shutter @3200ISO) for main camera and stable lens focus (even without OIS) - best for astrophotography. MacroLens works best in Pro mode where you can get nearest focus for some very detailed microscopic shots. You also get other stuff like metering control, pocket mode where it locks screen while still recording, peak overlay to show you what's in focus and what's not, timelapse with control over intervals [manual controls don't apply to front camera, and for other two sensors, shutter speed is very limited and final pictures are very blurry and have no detail whatsoever at ISO higher than 400. the camera app is native to Redmi software and doesn't support timelapse in manual mode; and other apps like CameraFV-5 don't work so well with bracketing/timelapse... proshot doesn't work at all. you can shoot timelapse in native app but then you won't get manual controls, which is useless for night]<br>  c.) All sensors are larger than usual phone sensors, which means better details in low light in all modes [but it doesn't mean they all capture good detail. the macro lens gives worst images and ultrawide isn't any good at all if you want detailed images. only the main sensor with its pixel binning does the actual job]<br>  d.) 1080p@120fps and 720p@240fps video encoded in x265 - fast and efficient [rest of slowmo modes are low performing, misguided and not very useful. 960fps mode is there, but it captures only 4 seconds of footage, with the 960fps slowmo applied only to the last 1 second - you have to time your shot very precisely to get it right. there's no sound alert for when it will begin slowmo. also, it isn't native 960fps, more like 480fps with merged frames to make it look like 960fps - capture very fast moving objects like shooting an arrow from bow, or vibrating guitar string and you'll get the artifacts that make it look so fake and ugly]<br>  Still, there are things where Redmi could have utilized their budget somewhere else - like Macro lens and Ultrawide aren't very practical. Not just for this phone, but they aren't practical in most phones (Ultrawide gives you wider view but distorts the periphery and people in edges), and in this phone, both Ultrawide and Macro lenses use low-res sensors (2MP for Macro and 8MP for UW), and they aren't good in low light, and even in full daylight they give much lesser detail and color/contrast than the main sensor. and the 64MP's full 64MP don't look any good when zoomed in to 100%, so don't expect to get sharp images from small sectors of a full 64MP photo. But it helps create a very sharp and detailed 16MP photo by combining pixels from 64MP sensor with data from other two cameras, which is kinda better than most expensive phones can do. Also, separating foreground from background is done VERY good (probably because of its AI-learning and 4-camera depth information - works well for front camera too). It can even separate individual hair strands in some cases if lighting is good and subject doesn't move - which is at par with what iPhone 11 Pro does with 3-camera unit.<br><br>6. Operating System and functions: Usually the custom-Android builds kind of tarnish the performance, but that isn't the case with this phone. Here's what I liked about it:<br>  a. it gives the freedom to use your own launcher homescreen app (which many other custom-UI Androids don't provide).<br>  b. The gaming mode is one of the best things about it - when playing fullscreen games like PUBG/ClashOfClans etc, you can swipe a corner and use Whatsapp/Facebook and Browser in small sidebar like area without leaving the game! even keyboard turns into short, floating version to help typing while keeping the game under eye. There is also a neat option to turn off display while keeping the game running without locking your phone.<br>  c. You can record the screen while gaming (which is fast and doesn't stress the system performance while recording) [but during the recording mode, the audio get desynced from what's going on in the game. this also happens if you connect wireless headphones or cast the screen to your TV/monitor. but this isn't a RedMi issue. it happens in every device when you record/cast audio or video wirelessly]<br>  d. Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly, there are no mismatches so far as I've used. Hope it stays that way.<br>  e. Native call recorder in calling screen which records both your voice and caller's voice in neat detail (unlike most phones where you can't hear other person in recording unless they're on speaker)<br><br>Final Verdict: A great phone to have for this price. It isn't just a cheap phone because price is cheap. It's actually a good device with good battery and smooth performance everywhere. There are some areas where RedMi could've done better instead of putting four cameras, but then again you're getting what other phones can't give you even at double the price so I shouldn't be complaining about this at all. :)</span>",3 people found this helpful

Because of too much bump of the camera , so be careful with that or use a good quality back cover for protection<br><br>2. Camera - 5/5. Depth ,details can be seen very clearly, hdr is good nd because of hdr is available in all the way, wide angle is gud , macro lens is clear but not that much i expected but in this price range it is best, video at 4k overall good.<br><br>3. Performance - the main and the foremost thing that everyone thinks about the perfomance, nd now this beast comes with Helio G90T which is too much powerful processor for gaming, multitasking , nd power packed work , pubg , cod  plays at higher resolution at ease . The best performance and gaming phone in this budget .<br><br>4- Design - the back glass is with gorilla glass 5 and it luks amazing with 3 different colour i prefer white for attractive luk but for elegant luks u can go for gamma green.<br><br>5- Battery &amp; charging - it comes 4500 mah battery which works well a day or more , if u are heavy usager so it can give up to 1 day to u nd for normal users it can give more than a day . Charging is gud but 18 w charger seems to be more faster than it is.

NeeKap,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Read Before You Buy....,Reviewed in India on 9 January 2020,"<span>Okay guys this is the review that you would want to read before you buy this phone...<br>Bought this as a new year present to self n now after two days of usage this is what I've to say....<br>Pros<br>1. Battery life. Guys the battery is huge n after one charge previous morning n one full day of heavy usage it's still showing 36% of juice left in it.<br>2. Fingerprint Reader. It's as good as they come...no problem whatsoever...works like a dream...<br>3. Design. Staple MI design, the quad cam setup with finger print reader is perfectly positioned...it's not premium but hey I'm not complaining...<br>4. Processor n RAM. I'm using the 6+128GB variant, RAM optimisation is brilliant, G90 with Octa Core@ 2.05GHz is doing the job wonderfully well...<br>5. Alexa. For all those Alexa fans, it's a welcome feature at no extra cost...<br>6. MIUI. comes with MIUI Global 10.4.4...which is smooth n user friendly nd I'm sure the latest patch will be available soon...<br>7. Budget. @16000/ this is reasonably priced considering the competition in the segment.<br>Cons<br>1. Weight. This is a huge phone...n hence it's bulky n after some time Ur hand starts to pain...<br>2. Camera quality. I was a bit disappointed with the camera quality considering it's a quad cam setup with 64 MP as primary..but hey it's okay at this price<br>3. Single hand operation. Found it a lil difficult owing to its size.<br>4. Overall feel. Not very premium, polycarbonate back, looks n feel very cheap.<br>Overall...I would say it's a good budget buy with all those features....Don't go looking for something extraordinary...then u will enjoy it...<br>Lastly a word about Amazon delivery...Ordered at 1800h in evening n received at 0800h in the morning through free delivery option, mind boggling...<br>Thanks for reading...found it useful...leave a like...</span>",One person found this helpful

ATUL KAKKAR,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working in 11 days..... Dissatisfied with Redressal,Reviewed in India on 29 November 2019,"<span>The phone's proximity sensor developed a problem in 11 days (10 days is return/replacement window). The proximity sensor got activated the moment a call is made or answered, even without taking the phone to the ear, due to which once the call is connected, I wasn't able to access the screen (Keypad, Add call, Disconnect call, Look for other information.....could do nothing). Had to take it to the service centre, who tried S/W reload, but to no avail. Then they asked me to request Amazon for replacement, which Amazon blatantly refused as it was already the 12th day. As Xiaomi service centre didn't even have spares of this phone yet, they agreed to put it for replacement. I submitted the phone on 14th Nov. and I am still waiting to receive the replacement phone. This is my first Xiaomi phone and I have to say it is a regrettable experience thus far.<br><br>However, on paper the phone looks good and hope the actual performance will also be good. But will be able to comment on that, once I am able to use the phone.<br><br>Xiaomi, if you are listening - PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!!</span>",3 people found this helpful

Anindya Sundar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely the best camera phone in the segment,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2019,"<span>Things I love about it:<br>The CAMERA IS REALLY CAPABLE, compared some shots with Galaxy S10e and my Reno 10x Zoom, I can tell in normal day light situations differences are minor, in low light condition it also does an excellent job, dynamic range is good but not great, macro images I have taken are amazing to look at, ultra-wide camera is okay. Considering the price it is really the best camera smartphone around 15k.<br>Recorded Videos with main are also good, it has EIS which does a fine job of stabilizing.<br>Reliable 2 day battery life for me as I don't play games too often.<br>Mediatek G90T does a great job of handling day-to-day apps.<br>Pubg mobile is running smooth with HDR+ultra frame rate.<br><br>Things I like:<br>Premium looking design, bought the Halo white color, gorilla glass on both sides.<br>It is splash proof which is better than having no ingress protection at all, provides a little peace of mind.<br>New HDR display which is bright enough.<br>Dedicated microSD card slot.<br><br>Things I don't like:<br>Still no app drawer in the UI, lots of unnecessary apps, unwanted ads, confusing settings menu.<br>While competitors have super Amoled it has an LCD screen.<br>Faced a little bit heating while playing games, though it is not that much compared to previous phones.</span>",One person found this helpful

SShah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Very DISAPPOINTING,Reviewed in India on 13 February 2020,"<span>I had second thoughts about buying Redmi Note 8 Pro as I was planning to go for Samsung M30S. But since I have used Redmi for many years, I decided to use same brand.<br><br>When I got the mobile first, I was surprised and very happy that it had option like Slow Motion in Camera, and most importantly, it has dedicated Memory Card slot. Which is generally not available in China models.<br><br>But within one week, I started noticing the mobile was slow sometimes, getting hung very often and gets very hot after using just to browse Facebook for 2 hours. Even when charging the mobile gets too hot.<br><br>It is a real disappointment. I also checked with couple of other who purchased Redmi 8 and Redmi Note 8 Pro during same time of sale, and all of them have the same problem. So I am not sure if Redmi offered the discount price just to sell of their defective piece. Unfortunately the problems started after 7-10 days and so there is no use of exchange as the exchange period is also over.<br><br>A real disappointment and waste of money. I would not recommend anyone to buy this mobile. Redmi had my full faith as I have used Redmi mobiles since last 5 years and my wife is using Redmi Note 7. But this time, I should have stuck to my instinct and not got Redmi Note 8 Pro.</span>",One person found this helpful

Macro lens i<br>have useless clarity.<br>2. I has 3A charger with Quick Charge. But it takes more than 25% more time to charge, in comparison to original Mi 2A charger.<br>3. Most worst feature of Redmi Note 8 pro us its GPS. It is not recording or displaying correct route, although GPS signal is full. Mi fit is showing strange path in form of straight lines. Other phones are working fine within same locality. Writing to Xiaomi at service.in@xiaomi.com got no solution.<br>4. Phone lags due to poor Helio processor.<br>5. Bluetooth have severe problem. It is not working with various bluetooth earphones like Infinity Glide 100, Sony 200 etc. On call, it sends voice exactly after 15 seconds. I returned Infinity glide 100 earphone thinking that earphone is faulty but same earphone is working in other phones.<br>Service center is unable to rectify these problems.<br>  I request Amazon to post this without any alteration so that other customers may be benefited by not purchasing Redmi Note 8 Pro phone.<br>Amazon and its seller did their best.

Shah,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not much as I expected!,Reviewed in India on 18 December 2019,"<span>I've got this phone two weeks back and have been using it for the past ten days.<br><br>Fingerprint reader - fast, accurate and good!<br><br>Screen size- neither too big, nor too small! Just as what we want<br><br>Display clarity - you may think that this phone lacks amoled display, but trust me! Even though using IPS LCD, its way better! But yea, you may find the screen brightness not too bright or sufficient enough..<br><br>Camera quality - this is what I wanted to say about, I don't know whether it's just my phone fault or some kind of issue, whenever I click pictures, it definitely has some distortions or some noise! I've took a lot of photos but still I don't feel it as 64 mp cam phone! This is where I want to go for realme XT!<br><br>Battery life - I was using redmi note 7 pro(4000 mah) before this one, and I seriously don't feel any difference between these two despite this 8 pro having a 4500 mah battery!<br><br>Quick charge - yea just as the name depicts, it's quick! But not fast enough as you want<br><br>Performance - having helio G90T as it's core chipset, it performs well.. but there's still a second lag, when you clear your memory and return to home screen! You can go on gaming without any worry, but phone may heat up slightly when you go on gaming for more than 40 mins!<br><br>These issues that I have found may be because of miui 10, where miui 11 has some improvements in system!

Ritesh Ranjan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very big mistake... Please don't waste your money.,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2020,<span>Very Big Mistake.... Please waste your money in REDMI NOTE 8 PRO.<br><br>Phone was working good but could not hold for even 1 month. The problem was with charging and finally ended up with a dead phone.<br><br>Went to MI authorized service centre. They said that parts for this phone is not available with them and can take a long time... Long time is now really long time... It's complete lockdown in India and I am left without a mobile phone ( a companion in such situation). I don't have any Idea that how long will it take to come back to me.<br>Big thing is that warranty will not be extended even the phone will remain with company's authorized service centre for long time where fault is from their side as they don't have parts.</span>,One person found this helpful
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Satisfied,Reviewed in India on 18 November 2019,"<span>Buy this product at the first flash sale. I was really excited about this device but after receiving the product not happy at all.<br>Major issue:<br>1. Proximity sensor didn't work properly. Screen Light was still on after receiving the call and touching my ear with the phone, even sometimes not able to declined tha call.<br><br>2. Selfie camera is unable to focus the person standing behind me. If I'm taking the selfie and I'm in front  then camera is only focusing me, the person behind me or beside me getting blurred.<br>3. Sometimes LED light continuously on even without getting any notification.<br><br>So after my replacement  proximity sensor is fine but still selfie camera focusing issue is there.<br>Not satisfied</span>",2 people found this helpful
Shobhit,1.0 out of 5 stars,Genuine review from ardent Redmi fan,Reviewed in India on 23 February 2020,"<span>I've been using Xiaomi phones since they launched Mi3. I've owned Redmi More 4/5/6 as well asking with buying multiple other variants for my family.<br><br>THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST XIAOMI PHONE. The phone is full of bugs with no resolution. E.g.<br>- *ALL my SMS disappeared overnight*. This is common issue (Google it)<br>- NO WIFI - Post miui 11 update, my wifi keeps showing ""connecting"" or ""limited connectivity"". I'm using my old Redmi Note 4 for Amazon Prime/YouTube/ other videos on same wifi<br>- BATTERY: The 4000 mah battery doesn't last as much as Redmi Note 6 even though it made phone so heavy. I come back home from office with 20% odd battery<br>- CAMERA: Removed regular slow Mo from camera. Wide angle, 2x zoom quality is poor. Camera speed is a joke as it keeps changing exposure / focus even millisecond. Removed fingerprint click for selfie. Night mode is a useless. Pro mode is what I bought it for and is good<br>- ADS: Ads within miui in cleaner, video player, file manager and every default app will drive you crazy<br>OTHERS:<br>- Dates of camera pictures changed on their own. So now they are not in right order and difficult to find<br>- Pictures disappeared in gallery. Showing in file manager<br>- Randomly it decides that some photos can't be moved to albums<br>- Auto rotate keeps jumping even after calibration<br><br>There are some positives, but many more bugs that I haven't listed and bad experience far outweighs the positives.<br><br>I regret buying this phone and that Xiaomi is not coming with solutions. It's just sad.</span>",One person found this helpful

Nandu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Built for gamers. .Review after 3 weeks..,Reviewed in India on 17 June 2020,"<span>Well i am using this phone for a couple of weeks and i found that battery is draining faster, hope will be fixed with an update. For playing PUBG this phone is remarkable not facing any lags, well i play with smooth/Extreme graphics settings. This is built for gamers and we cant find a phone under 20k price range for best gaming, G90T is built for gaming. No issues in day to day usage as i installed a lot of Apps and still running smoothly. I went for a 6/64 variant as i have a memory card of 128 gb. Thanks to that extra slot. Display is quite good in this price range comparing with realme 6, good brightness level and HDR10 supported. Build quality is premium, nice and handly, looks premium, just dissappointed with fingerprint sensor built parallel to camera. Ram management is quite good. Go for it guys if you are an insane gamer and looking a phone under 20k price range. Little bit heating üî• issue is there but not crossed 41 in room temperature while playing PUBG in extreme graphics which i prefer, but we wont find any lag.charging time is about 2 hours from 15 to 100 percent.and 100 to 30 percent for 5 to 6 games of pubg thats approx 2 hrs or more. .speaker quality is normal. Give likes if u find this usefull. Cheers ü•Ç üëç</span>",One person found this helpful
thefourtheye,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Pubg performance - *NOT* a gaming phone - Waste of money,Reviewed in India on 18 January 2020,"<span>If you are buying this to play pubg, you'll be disappointed. I read other reviews saying it's good for pubg. Yes, if there is no one near you or if you play tdm, it's fine. In classic, getting a single kill in close range combats is a miracle. It doesn't matter which guns are at play. Even if you have groza and if your opponent has a pistol, you would lose. Frames get dropped a lot to the point where you can't really see what is going on. Aiming is not possible at all. Mid range and long range fights are fine. You can't rush enemies with this phone. For a phone advertised as having a processor optimized for gaming, its really not worth its salt. PS: my review is based on the following graphics settings: Smooth and Medium frame rate, no anti-aliasing.<br><br>Apart from that, the battery life is good. Camera is decent for this price range.<br><br>Verdict: Helio G90T fails to deliver.<br><br>Edit: I realised that the red shade of screen is not a feature but a bug. Apparently there is no fix for that. Basically if you have some money to waste, go for this mobile, as there will be no resale value with major problems like these.</span>",2 people found this helpful

Babu C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful performance. Great looks and value.,Reviewed in India on 24 January 2020,"<span>A beautiful phone. Halo White looks exquisite.<br>I was torn between Samsung M30 S which was cheaper for Great Indian sale and Realme X2 on Flipkart. But Redmi note 8 pro had more good reviews. Got 10 % discount with credit card for 6gb ram / 128 gb storage.  Samsung has a plastic body vs. Redmi's gorilla glass front and back which looks premium, which was a deciding factor for me.<br>Camera also is better than Samsung. Has a good battery and 18 w fast charger. Display is vibrant. Touch and finger print scanner is quick without lags.<br><br>Finger print scanner is right below the camera lens on the back so your finger smudges lens if you are not used to it, if you have used front finger print scanner.<br>Not a big fan of MiUI coming from pure Android. Disabled all ads and bloatware before first use. MiUI has dark mode which is good.<br>This is a powerful phone performance wise.<br>Only complaint is the ringtone volume is not very loud.<br>Phone is a bit heavy but the battery is of higher capacity.</span>",

C Sricharan,2.0 out of 5 stars,More bad than good,Reviewed in India on 12 March 2020,"<span>I'm going to tell you what the reviewers don't. The network on this phone ranges from decent to lousy. On my old Nokia 6.1 Plus, I used to get 4G network in sections of Mumbai that this phone just doesn't manage. Call drops and random silences are another thing. I already got a replacement for this reason alone but the newer phone is no improvement. I narrowly missed the replacement deadline being out of station on work. Then there are irritations like the message tones not changing to what you set ... So no matter what you set, only the default one rings. Yes, Bluetooth plays in LDAC which is nice but the ear piece volume is so low that I have to use the handsfree all the time. Not something that I had a problem with on the Nokia. In fact, my other choice was the Nokia 7.2 and I should have gone for that. Android One and Nokia are indeed a good combination and this glitchy phone reaffirms that.<br>Ps: the auto brightness also doesn't work properly ... I have to either manually increase it or shade the phone to change the response to the ambient light.</span>",

Light sensor works good and changes brightness as per light conditions.<br>Processor if smooth but not as swift as it could be.<br>Battery will last full Day if used 4-5 Hours... for normal use it Will last 1and a half day.<br>Memory card support. I have put a 64 GB card thereby getting a capacity of 6/128 @12400+550= 12950/- ....<br>Cons:<br>Selfie camera is good but all other cameras are satisfactory only<br> It takes crispy images but not with sharp details rather does some make up kind of job.<br>Night mode makes pic like painting not clear.<br>Those who are in the fancy of 64 mega pixels should rethink...a camera with lesser mega pixel can do wonder ... this race of mega pixel is useless.<br><br>A little bit heavier than usual... because it flaunts gorilla glass front and back...but this makes it sexy too.<br><br>Overall I got 6/64 @12400 ... this is almost a look a like of one+..... At this budget...it's a good phone than Oppo or Vivo....even better than Samsung M30s.....</span>",

Mishal Mohammed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Performance Beast For The Price,Reviewed in India on 26 November 2019,"<span>The variant I bought was the 128GB storage with 6GB RAM in the Gamma Green colour.<br><br>Design &amp; Build: The colour and design of the back feels premium with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The curved edge makes it comfortable to hold the phone even though it weighs more than an average phone. The weight distribution is done well.<br><br>Display: The IPS LCD panel is excellent and feels premium. Measuring at 6.53"", it is definitely big but you'll get used to it. Or not.<br><br>Performance: The new processor has silenced the critics with impeccable performance. I haven't noticed any stutters or glitches. Multitasking runs smoothly with good RAM management.<br><br>Battery: 4500 mAh battery is a monster. I easily got 11-12 hrs of screen-on time with 30 mins of gaming. If you're a casual user, it could easily last two days on a single charge. The included 18W charger is an added bonus.<br><br>Camera: The quad camera is good at the price range but nothing extraordinary. Low light photos are noisy and could be corrected with Gcam or future updates.<br><br>Cons: 1) At 6.53"", forget about one handed use. So if size is a big deal for you, this isn't the best choice.<br>2) MIUI and its ads. Fortunately you can turn off most of it and delete the bloatware.<br>3) Camera isn't professional grade by any means. 64 MP is fine and all, but that should not be the deciding factor.<br><br>Verdict: At this price point, I would definitely RECOMMEND this as it is a good all round phone. Performance wise, this is a BEAST. Gamma Green and Halo White are the best colours of the pack.</span>",2 people found this helpful

Great camera -- The more i am using more i am learning. I have SLR but these photos are really good.<br>2. Attending per day 6 hrs of  online classes with video recording .  Never failed . Also i am using multi tasking mode.<br>3. The response is awesome. I can perform online video processing when doing other work. Brilliant.<br>4. The battery is a little disappointing. I had to do a quick charge twice.<br>5. It has to overheat protection. Whenever my mobile gets overheated then redmi switches some of the unnecessary options<br>6.  Ia have tons of pplication related to educatioonal music and video processing also many testing toll. Actually i replaced my damanged laptop with this phone . I cannot thak redmi enough for the powerful processing with zero lag . One advice. There is one PUBG turbo mode. If you enable that during your video processing it boosts up performance significantly.<br><br>I got stuck in lockdown in a remote place. But this mobile saved me from all the hassles. from remote access to multiple class and video processing its a powerhouse<br><br>I would have given 5 star but BATTERY! !!!!<br>Recommended highly this phone</span>,

Firdous,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't feel premium at all.,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2019,"<span>I received it in the very 1st sale. But review option wasn't allowed then. So writting now almost after 2 weeks of usage, Mobile is so so. Camera is just above ok. Mobile seems heavy while you are watching movies or playing games. Mobile doesn't look premium, built quality is like plastic made. Note 7 pro is still the best mobile in Redmi series.</span>",
Manoj Warrier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Redmi Note 8 Pro... Stunning in looks. Awesome in performance. Unmatched in Price,Reviewed in India on 29 November 2019,"<span>The Redmi Note 8 Pro surprised me. The delivery was pretty fast. Got it the very next day by 11 a.m. After unboxing, the phone had about 59% power and it lasted the whole day. The phone is extremely elegant in looks and feel. We selected the gamma green and its envying. The phone is just one day old and is being used by my wife.  The UI is very smooth ( but the in-built ads can be annoying sometimes).  The navigation is very smooth. I did play one game for a long time and did not find any lag or heating up issues. The camera is out of this world. Alexa is mind-blowing. FM Radio is equally good. The sound output is real. The video clarity is remarkable. It has separate dual nano sim slots and a dedicated slot for a memory card or expandable GBs. The silicon carry case is also of good quality.  I shall review this phone in detail at a later stage.</span>",One person found this helpful
jovian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Redmi note 8 pro 6/128gb Review.,Reviewed in India on 3 January 2020,"<span>Loved the phone.<br><br>Redmi did an awesome job with this phone.<br>Tho at first the camara was noise and dull but after updating it to miui 11 it is really awesome i cant stop taking pics from the 64mp.<br>Now about the performance, i would say it gives you the feeling as tho you are playing on a premium phone i played it for 6 hours straight on HDR+ with high refresh rate. The phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops. There was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating. The battery was amazing it lasted for 8 hrs (6hrs of high setting which left it at 5 percentage and the 2 hours of mild usage) i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving. The wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light image does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison.<br>Haptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving. The audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room. :)  There are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy ( sadly it managed to uninstall Pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain) but that fine i installed it again.<br>The call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there. Internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you, you will face really slow speeds.  my airtel is the worst<br>With speed from very good to worst.<br>1) jio/vodaphone. Both sims have 4g active at once. So you you turn on inter on one the other won't goto 3g.<br>2) idea tho it's part of voda now but not as good as voda<br>3) airtel.<br>The download speeds for jio are at 2 mb/s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed 10mb/s i did get 10 mb/s but after 3 to 6 am when network traffic is reduced. With voda i got 800 kb/s to 2mb/s it staded at 2mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio.<br>Ideo had 600kb/s  to 1mb/s that was the best i got from it.<br>Now it's airtel with 160 kb/s to 400kb/s<br>I was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen.<br>You have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area.<br><br>I hope this helps i will try to update of any changes.</span>",
Guru,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very decent phone with excellent features. But camera isn't that great.,Reviewed in India on 2 January 2020,"<span>Looks: 5/5 (Good and slim phone)<br>Ergonomics: 4.5/5 (placement of FP scanner is quiet annoying)<br>UI: 5/5 (I believe that MiUi is best ever designed UI. Simple yet powerful. Not much of junks pre-installed)<br>Camera: 4/5 (As a professional photographer, i merely enjoyed clicking with wide angle camera. Images are not as expected. But 64mp rocks, the best camera out of remaining three or technically 2. Bcuz one is a depth sensor. As I'm not find of selfie, i cannot comment on front camera. But it's good as i use it for video calling.)<br>Storage: 5/5 (128GB for me is enough as I organise my files.)<br>Battery: 4.5/5 (Good backup, but quiet slow charging when compared to my previous phone or atleast that's what my experience says)<br>Hardware: 5/5 (No lags or heating issues, but had heating issues initially while setting up the phone)<br>Screen: 5/5 (Smooth and good. Quiet realistic colors when compared to some of the over saturated phones.)<br>Sound: 3.5/5 (very low sound. But if used with a good earphones, it gives a better experience)<br><br>Overall a better phone in its range and good buy.</span>",

Abhishek Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Performance Beast. Killer Cameras.,Reviewed in India on 2 March 2020,"<span>Probably the best phone under 15k or even 20k, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that. Yes, it lacks a few things like an AMOLED display, Inbuilt fingerprint Scanner which it's competitors offer, but still this phone beats them when it comes to overall performance, the Mediatek Helio G90T processor is no joke, this thing scored 28-29k on Antutu benchmark, way ahead than the phones offered on even greater budgets. I don't play games, but the overall performance is very fluidic when heavily multitasked. The camera is another plus point, day light shots are phenomenal, low light shots are good, but the tables turn when you install GCAM! Yes, the phone now supports GCAM fully right out of the box. You just need to install it along with a proper configuration file. That's it, go for this your eyes closed. I'm a neophyte when it comes to clicking pictures, but you can do better. So, attaching a few shots, shot with GCAM astrophotography mode.<br>Edit: Love this phone even more, learnt to click pictures in pro mode, and surprisingly I think they are even better than GCAM low light shots; I have added a few more pictures for you to see.</span>",

You should absolutely go for this beast and beauty. Redmi is doing justice to its consumer with such competitive phones.. This phone easily competes with the price range of 20K phones. All in all a must buy for under 15K buyers, don't go anywhere else. Note 9pro is a gimmic, with nothing much inside. Think before you buy.</span>",

The display quality is very good considering the IPS panel installed on it. It gives good competition to AMOLED.<br>2. The Build quality is premium and I liked it so much. While colour looks good.<br>3. The camera performance in day light condition is very good.<br>4. Audio output is good.<br>5. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very fast and accurate.<br>6. Have done some gaming and performance is very good. Haven't experience much heating issue. Phone gets little warm at the back specially near camera setup but cools down quickly. The outside temperature  plays big roll here.<br>7. Touch response and overall RAM management is good.<br><br>Thinks I didn't like;<br>1. The camera performance at night is terrible, as photos captured have lot of noise. Need fix for it from Xiaomi.<br>2. Most of the pre-installed apps can not be disabled.<br>3. The MI apps and priorities given to these apps. e.g. there was a gesture which will open google search if swipe up is done anywhere on screen. However, after recent updates, it was changed from Google search to MI browser.<br><br>Overall this is a good buy at this price point and you will not be disappointed at all. .<br><br>Edit: I have been using this device for almost 5 months now. I found one major and most important problem with this. That is network reception and stability. I am currently in low network scenario. When I saw mobile from brands like Realme, Samsung can provide good signal and 4G reception, MI devices suck. I am getting poor 4G network with this. Also, after 11.0.4.0 update on MIUI, if you got any call and network changed to 2G, to change it to 4G, I have to restart it again. Before 11.0.4.0 rom, airplane mode used to work. Pissed off this device.. No exchange offers as well to change it and buy new device.. Please consider this fact before buying MI device, specially if you live in low network area. Go for other brands..</span>",One person found this helpful

Go for Samsung because in this price lots of options and quality of camera and display and resolution is far better than xomi mobile. I only suggest every buyer don't go for review on YouTube or others. Please compare Samsung mobile and xomi in your hand and compare youus be realis I have cheated by xomi. I have compared and realized I have cheated by xomi.</span>,One person found this helpful

Sajan Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,An All-Rounder,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,"<span>I have been using this phone for around 2 months now and I'm quite happy with the performance of the phone.<br>The fingerprint scanner is exceptionally fast and has an astute haptic feedback. I was particularly happy with the camera quality. Although the 64MP option is not really useful (as it just eats up all of the disc space), it is really cool to have that feature and the photos taken in the 64MP feature turned on is sharp and crisp and encorporate a lot more details.<br>The Helio G90T processor is really fast and responsive and works pretty well for gaming and for ordinary day-to-day tasks as well, although it being a 13nm process doesn't really help with the battery life. It lasted me hardly a day and I can't quite complain, considering the fact that I use the phone a lot and do a lot of heavy gaming like PUBG Mobile (the game runs on high graphic settings by default) but if you are a normal user who uses the phone for day-to-day tasks, it would probably last you a day and a half or more. The 18W fast charger provided with the phone charges it pretty quickly considering the 4500 mah battery of the Redmi Note 8 Pro.<br>Although it has an IPS LCD screen, it's one of the best screens so far with as deep blacks as an AMOLED screen.<br>All in all, it's an all-rounder of a phone and if you are looking for one that is in the sub-15000 Rs range, then this is definitely a phone that you should check out.</span>",One person found this helpful
Deepak,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the quality and camera,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2020,"<span>I would say that this is the best phone available in this price range. Super built with amazing functions and speed is way more than what you require.  Camera quality is something which I didn't find as per the specifications but it's better than others.

Vishu,1.0 out of 5 stars,Malfunctioning screen,Reviewed in India on 17 June 2020,"<span>Got the device yesterday evening. Checked it out today and found that the screen has a very Erratic response to touches. The minimise button locks the phone so no multi apps at a time. The display kind of resets and reaches to home and the work being done in an app is lost.You need to start all the work again. I had to take another phone to write the whole review as this phone kept on refreshing/resetting on its own. Seems, I am unfortunate to get a malfunctioning device.<br>Amazon technical support yielded no response.<br>Awaiting action from amazon team</span>",

While playing games, the mobile heats up even though its has liquid cool technology. But this is a minor issue of high end gaming processor.<br><br>Xiaomi offer a user friendly interface which I personally think is better than any other brand.<br><br>Screen size is also big.

Vaibhav Mishra,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,Reviewed in India on 3 December 2019,"<span>I am rating this product 5/5.<br>Well, according to me, this device is a perfect value for üí∞.<br>Let's talk about each and every segment of this device. I am going to give an unbiased review as I am not a MI fan and this is my first MI/Xiaomi device.<br><br>CAMERA: Pictures captured in day light( normal default mode)contain a lot of details. 64MP doesn't need any introduction. Each 64MP pic varies from 18 MB to 30-35MB in size. They have a lotta details when you zoom in. Portrait shots are awesome too.<br>Night pics are decent too. They are above average. Not as good as Iphone 11 though, of course, but considering the price it's awesome.<br>Macro shots are incredibly awesome. I mean you can just take a pic from 1-2CMs focal distance.<br><br>ULTRA-WIDE lens serves it purpose well, but slightly fades out the colors. The pic from ultrawide in daylight are very good, but indoor lighting are not that sharp and a little bit of lack color saturation, Hope Xiaomi fix it in updates.<br><br>SPEAKER: SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT, CRISP AND CLEAR. It cannot be compared with STEREO SPEAKERS mobiles like ONEPLUS 7T or S9+ but yes, considering that it is a SINGLE GRILL FIRING SPEAKER, the quality is decent and it's loud enough.<br><br>NETWORK STRENGTH: NO ISSUES AT ALL. Everything works fine. No call drops, no speed issue<br>BUT NOTE 8 PRO isn't giving me 4G+(CARRIER AGGREGATION) SIGNALS. DON'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE NETWORK OPERATOR ISSUE OR MAYBE IT DOESN'T SUPPORT INDIAN OPERATORS 4G+.<br>4G WORKS PERFECTLY.<br><br>DISPLAY: It can't be compared with Amoled or S.Amoled but I just wanna say, I simply don't care. It is bright, and colors are sharp and contrast is very good. It supports HDR+(useful only when you watch HDR content).<br><br>BATTERY: 4500 MAH, is enough for a moderate user for watching videos , WhatsApp, fb etc. Will easily give you around 1.5 days with still some juice left. If you are a heavy user then it might give you 8-9 hrs backup if you use continuously.<br><br>DESIGN: SUPERB. IT'S HOT. No doubt. Back is just awesome and gives you a premium feeling when you hold this phone.<br><br>BUILD: The device is around 200GRAMS. It is a bit heavy, but trust me, you will get used to it. And after 2-3 days you won't even feel that it's heavy. It's just getting used to it. Positioning of fingerprint sensor is inaccurate and sometimes you might touch the 3rd camera lens above the sensor. But again, you will get used to it.<br><br>CAMERA BUMP is there, so use a good quality case to protect it.<br><br>PERFORMANCE: HELIO G90T+ 6GB RAM(MINIMUM), CMON, it won't show you any lags. It's buttery smooth even for gamers. Yes , this CHIPSET cannot be compared with SNAPDRAGON 855+ but still, after one level, all are decent ones.<br><br>RAM management is decent too, and switching between the apps is smooth and lag free.<br><br>Overall, it's an awesome device.<br>As first customer of Xiaomi, I am happy with the device.</span>",

Puti imsong,4.0 out of 5 stars,My take on the Note 8 pro,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2020,"<span>Let me highlight the pros and cons<br><br>Pros.<br><br>1. Fingerprint detection is lightning fast.<br><br>2. Battery life is absolutely great.<br><br>3. Miui 11 is much better than their past UI.<br><br>4. Build quality is top notch.<br><br>5. You can use two sims plus 1 microsd separately.<br><br>6. At first i was sceptical about mediatek as in the past i encountered a lot of lagging and hanging problems but this Processor the Speed and performance is the best i have ever used on a budget phone it feels like using the Snapdragon 800 series with no problems. Great job Xiaomi.<br><br>7. I lost my led light controller but thanks to the infrared on this phone i can control my lights now also TV and stuff. It's a neat feature.<br><br>Cons.<br><br>1. If your buying this mobile for photography. DONT BUY PLEASE. under natural light photos look good but under unnatural lights it looks really bad. Now some might say camera is superb but i guess this is the only phone they have ever used with a camera of this category of smartphones. Trust me the nokia 7.1 though old its camera is much much better. Also the macro lens is pathetic and the selfie too. Megapixels don't make photos good. The image processing software does so Xiaomi is still way far behind.<br><br>2. Wifi speed does not exceed 1.2Mbps for some reason. And i did a quick Google search many people have same issue.<br><br>3. Phone feels a little too big though it is really nice for watching videos and reading.<br><br>4. I have used better display than this note 8 pro in its category. My issue is with the pixels when your typing your phone you can see the small diodes. Though i believe it's because i have used better phones and it's a distraction only for me and that i am Focusing too much on it.<br><br>Conclusion<br>If your a person like me who wants to play games and use whatsapp insta and such and click pictures on the go and don't care much about it, big battery, good display, performance like a beast go for this phone instead of a flagship phone and rather save the money and buy an ipad mini in the future.</span>",

anurag,4.0 out of 5 stars,Note 8 pro does what it says except battery backup!,Reviewed in India on 14 January 2020,"<span>A great phone in this budget. After a week's time, my experience is good except for the battery performance and fingerprint sensor position. A battery of new phone having just one day life after full charge is something unexpected keeping in view I am a moderate user and dont play pubg or games.Secondly, position of fingerprint sensor is prehistoric. How can designer make such mistake by aligning camera and fingerprint sensor in one single line and that too at the back of the phone.This bad alignment ignites chances of contamination of lenses while one tries to unlock phone using finger and yeah not to forget our fingers are often dirty, aren't they üòú.<br>Well now comes camera which is fabulous. 64 megapixel does wonders exactly the way manufacturer describes.Also, phone dimensions are little exaggerated but one can always use ""One-handed operation"" feature and you will start loving the length and breadth of it instantly.<br>Overall a nice budget phone and worth buy !!<br>Let me know if you would like to hear about any other feature.

The phone is snappy and I did not find any issue in general usage.<br>UI : the best and worst UI. Most user friendly UI ever made is married with unnecessary Ads.<br>Gaming : Gaming is smooth on the phone and did not find any issue<br>Fingerprint scanner : placed at a very odd position. Finger smudges the camera often.<br>Camera: The most dissapointing feature (also the reason I bought the phone ) is the camera. The front cam is Great but the back camera is pathetic. In the same price range Realme/ViVo provide much much better cameras. Night mode is a gimmick and distorts the image completely. Macro mode too is just a gimmick.<br><br>Overall a decent phone for moderate usage. Don't buy if you are looking for a camera fone.</span>,One person found this helpful
MYK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money. User interface is dull but usability is good. Feature loaded,Reviewed in India on 28 February 2020,"<span>I am writing this review after using the device (Redmi note 8 pro) for about 15 days. I must say I am pretty surprised to see the capabilities of this device in this price range. First I must mention that 6GB ram n 128GB memory(ROM) in 16k was a steal deal for me. The battery lasts for about a day with more than moderate to quite heavy usage. If I use it with respect battery lasts for about a day n half easy with about 15% juice left. With better t saver it will easily stretch to 2 days with less than moderate usage. Finger print reader is almost accurate for about 4 out of 5 times, it also depends on how perfectly we do the initial scan of finger. Feel is very smooth and display is crisp n very detailed with a premium feel to the touch and response. My only disappointment so far is with the user interface. It does not have any app list like in other OS. MIUI just let's all apps on home screen making it a clutter. So I have to arrange it as per usage.<br>A very important thing to mention here is that though I received a fast charger in the box but it does not do quick charge. I thought it does not show fast charging but it took about 3 n half to 4 hrs to chanrge using the stock charger. Then one fine day I used my powerbank which had fast charging and found it was doing a quick charge and did charge full in 2 hrs. Then I tried it with another charge which I knew was a fast charger and it also charged quick with proper notification on device. So here I don't know how I got a duplicate or defective charger in a sealed box. But I am disappointed with the charger to a great extent. Though I can buy a new one or just use charger of another device but this is the main reason I am deducting 1 star. Thanks for reading. Hope it helps make ur mind.</span>",

Enzy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Redmi note 8 pro review,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2019,"<span>One the best phone in the price range, camera Clarity is good, performance is also good, the only draw back is if you play games for a longer period of time like for an hour there is a slight heating issue but it's not a huge prob, once you turn off the game the mobile cools down rapidly fast.<br>Over all I prefer it it's one of a best phones in the market with these features under this price range. And has a good cooling system in the phone ..  people who need features camera n performance do go for it .. ,üòÅ</span>",2 people found this helpful
Santosh Kumar,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unmanageable touchscreen,Reviewed in India on 25 January 2020,"<span>I bought this product with lots of expectation. I have been using Redmi Note 3 for last three years. Such a wonderful phone. However, due to lack of space and low time of battery I thought to go for a new phone and this Redmi Note 8 pro has come freshly so I blindly jumped to this. I ordered and got it on 31st December; a very fast delivery by Amazon. However, when I started operating the phone its sound and basic settings are just like Note 3 with very minor improvement. The most disappointing part is its touch of key boards. Most of the time the touch of the letter keys does not type what you intend to and also very often touch of space key does not create space between words. So is the shift of key pad from alphabet to numbers also does not respond quickly. There is also a problem such as when you are watching a video and suddenly you have to move to some other work on the phone then navigating keys do not appear on the screen and then you have to switch off the phone sometimes. It is non-satisfactory phone. I dont know whether it is due to I bought online or due to some software issue, it needs to be checked. But I am dissatisfied with this piece.</span>",One person found this helpful

PROCESSOR:- The G90T mediatek processor is a gaming processor having very excellent performance.<br>2. BATTERY:- I am getting around 2 days of battery life sometimes even more than 2 days depending on my usage.<br>3. BUILT QUALITY and DESIGN is very stylish.<br>4. Camera quality is superb. Samsung sensor is good.<br>Now if u r confused between realme XT and note 8 pro...........both are good but note 8 pro has better battery life but lacks amoled screen and in display fingerprint but the processor of 8 pro is excellent.....and the fingerprint sensor at the back is very fast and responsive.!!!<br>Also I got 1 yr free screen replacement from AMAZON!!!</span>,

The rear camera is nice but selfie camera doesn't give what you expect from a 20mp camera. There is no heating isuses, it gets heated while Playing games but it also cools down very fast. You will playing PUBG in it . This is a perfect smartphone for gamers at this price range .

Aify,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall it is a good mobile, you will not regret after buying it üòä",Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019,"<span>Redmi Note 8 Pro (8GB ram, 128 GB storage space) was my third Redmi mobile. Previously I had Redmi 3s prime, and Redmi 4.<br><br>I am writing this review after using the phone for almost one week. I am a gaming freak. üòâ<br><br>Redmi Note 8 pro is one of the best mobile launched in the segment of below Rs. 20,000/-.<br><br>Camera is very good, but it needs natural light to make the photo crystal clear. There are grains in the photo, even in 64 MP lens, if the photos are taken in the low light area. So you need ample amount of light to make the photo clear, I mean to make you love your photos. üòâ<br><br>Selfie camera is also very good, specially that bokeh mode üòç, but again the same, you need ample amount of light to make the photos crystal clear or else you will find grains in your photos.<br><br>Performance is very good. Games like Pubg and Call of Duty Mobile can be played in High graphic without lag, but you should have decent internet speed. While playing games, the mobile heats up even though its has liquid cool technology. But this is a minor issue of high end gaming processor.<br><br>Xiaomi offer a user friendly interface which I personally think is better than any other brand.<br><br>Screen size is also big. It adds up to your entertainment.<br><br>Face recognition feature needs to be a little advanced since it unlocks the device but does not remove the lock screen wallpaper.<br><br>I personally like the halo white model because I myself bought it üòâ and I think its the better from the green and black one.</span>",One person found this helpful
Sanjay R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an in depth review of this phone after using it for 18 days,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2019,"<span>I bought this phone on first sale which was on 21st October and got it on the same day by paying 100 Rs extra for fast delivery and today after using it for 18 days I am writing this review So who ever want to buy this phone please read this this is an honest review<br>Pros:-<br>1:- Helio G90T processor is great as it is pretty fast and makes phone snappy, you can play pubg on hdr and ultra fps or smooth extreme fps no lag so far and no heating many people were saying it heats a lot and all that stuff but in reality my phone doesn't heat and i play for min 2-3 hrs daily on smooth extreme and i play with cover so it explains everything that the liquid cooling in it works really well and there is no heating issue<br>2:- It has a massive 6.53 in HDR 10 enable display which is pretty big and the bezels are too thin you can see only screen and the touch response is great in this phone while Playing games like pubg, COD etc overall screen is great.<br>3:- It comes with quad camera setup the picture taken with it are great and the 64 mp camera does a great job with details and its potrait mode is great too, the wide angle camera does a really great job and takes a great field of view and the macro camera actually works and click some really awesome images and video recording is great too you can record 1080p 60fps with stabilization and slow motion upto 960 fps you can also record videos on wide angle camera and macro camera and the selfie camera is good too it takes overall good selfies in low light too and natural images no artificial beautyfy no skin smoothing crap like oppo, vivo and realme.<br>4:- Battery life of this phone is great i get nearly 12 hr of screen on time and it includes 2-3 hr of COD 3 hr of YouTube and all social media apps like instagram, WhatsApp, twitter, facebook, taking photos, and watching Anime on Chrome for 2hrs and shopping apps like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Club factory etc for 1-2 hrs and i am done for the day still 1% remaining and it takes 1hr 30min to charge from 1 to 90 and I will recommend you not to charge phone over 90 % as it is good for battery health in long term and the above data i told you was from 100-1% battery to get the perfect screen on time.<br>5:- Fingerprint scanner is pretty fast and reliable and face unlock is great too as it's fast and accurate.<br>Sorry I can't put pictures i clicked from this phone as they are all personal and private pictures.<br><br>Cons:-<br>1:- Because of the HDR10 support the videos on YouTube seems a little whiteish and it annoyed me at the start but I am used to it now.<br>2:- It takes 30min to charge from 90 to 100 %<br>3:- The camera bump is too much you can't put your phone on floor on backside or you will get scratch on your camera lens.<br>4:- The Helio G90T processor is based on 12nm technology so it's not that battery efficient and for now it has no Google camera support if it would come with Google camera support in future the photos will be on next level.<br><br>Those are the only  cons i found till now<br><br>Thank you.</span>",One person found this helpful

You can play high graphics game without lagging.<br>2. Display is pretty good ( as they mentioned that they provide HDR FHD+ Display). I have compared this with redmi note 7s (which is FHD+). Color reproduction is Better compared to redmi note 7s.<br>3. Battery life is also good. It last for 1.5 day by normal using.<br>4. Performance of back camera is good in day light condition. it takes pretty good pics both 64mp and normal camera.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. In low light condition both the cameras back and front takes noise pictures.<br>2. Sometimes Selfie camera survives to detect the depth of the picture. The pictures looks noisy. (Waiting for the new update, by which they may resolve this issue.)<br>2. Video quality is not good in 1080p 30 fps. This problem can be resolved by using the higher mode (1080p 60fps or 4k) of the camera. ( You can not using these mode all the time as it needs more storage).<br>3. When playing high graphics game then the battery becomes very hot. (But the plus point is, it has liquid cooling system which helps to reduce the heat rapidly.)<br> # If you are a gamer then it can disappoint you. While playing high graphic games the battery drains rapidly.</span>",One person found this helpful

Phone gets a bit warm after playing heavy games for an hour or so.<br><br>2. Highly annoying camera bump and weird placement of fingerprint scanner.<br><br>3. Bit of ads but that can be dealt with<br>4. Phone is bit heavy weighs close to 200gms. Suits for people with big hands. It suited for me<br>5. IPS LCD display,  looks clear and sharp but not better than sAmoled screen.<br>6. Doesn't play HD videos for Prime and netflix, i guess it will be addressed theough software update.<br><br>Good stuff:<br><br>1. This is an ultimate gaming beast. All the games runs so smooth whatever you throw to it.<br><br>2. Day to day tasks are great and faster!! No lag whatsoever!<br><br>3. Amazing camera quality both rear and front.<br>4. Lightning speed fingerprint scanner.<br>5. Charging is quite fast with 18w charger.<br>6. Excellent battery life. Comes to solid two days inspite of playimg games.<br>7. Amazing network reception and call quality.<br>8. WiFi calling enabled.<br>9. Sturdy build quality. No compromise here. Gorilla glass all the way!<br>10.

Niranjan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Is it worth,Reviewed in India on 5 December 2019,"<span>It's one of the best phone around this range . Doesn't have the camera quality like realme XT<br>Best for gaming Mediatech Helio processor just fantastic. Even though having a Liquid cooling system it have a bit heating issue but not overheating but compared to Pocco F1 it's a bit hot I'm a YouTube content creator. So i use all this phone. If having a bit more budget will suggest to go for Redmi K20 pro Realme X2. Or if looking for a gaming phone go for Asus Rog phone 2. Best tuung is that we are having a Hand free Alexa It's so nice that we can access Alexa by saying ""Alexa"" and Als use Google Assistant at the same time which is not available for any other phone of this range. The only Thing A back draw is its display and the water notch display. It's so tempting that it's just having a led IPS Display. By the way anything can't be perfect. Not that good as Pocco F1 if anyone using Pocco F1 better don't change it. Never go for phone saying 64 MP 108 MP etc because not just Megapixel which matter the picture quality. It has a great photo precision. If it found helpful please follow me and Click of the ""helpful"".</span>",

Initially it was OK but after wards again and again rebooting was required. Once unfortunately it was got dropped in wet area and after some time stopped working and getting heated up. I contacted service centre on 25.05.20 for repair under warrant. I was told that there was moisture ingress and total expenditure will be approx Rs+9000 nine thousand and this is not covered in warranty. I told not to repair at this cost as  repair was approx 60% of the latest price. I really surprised why not covered under warranty..Any way I can say the sealing is not proper as moisture has intered inside....please suggest what to do....</span>,

I was a bit hesitant to buy the device because it had a mediatek processor which usually cause heating problems but I have played games like cod and pubg and it is running lag free on highest settings without much heating.

Vibhor,5.0 out of 5 stars,A versatile phone in the given range,Reviewed in India on 5 January 2020,"<span>So here is my review on various features after using this phone for about 2 months:<br>Battery life: it has a solid battery of 4500mAh, which you can use for full 2 days with normal usage.<br>Camera : An extremely superb camera; works well in all modes be it portrait mode, night mode, 64 mp mode, slow-motion video or selfie mode<br>RAM and processor : I played a few games on it(in high resolution) and never felt any sort of lagging,slowness thanks to the brilliant processor and huge RAM. Also has a game turbo mode that allows you to perform additional functions while playing the game.<br>Fast charging by Type C charger : I generally keep my mobile between 20-80 % . hence it takes roughly 45 - 50 mins to charge within this range.<br>64 GB storage : This humongous amount of storage allows installing any apps, videos, images without constantly working on removing unnecessary data. However the images taken through this camera being high quality generally take about 7-12 mb of storage and i think i may need a microsd in the future when videos and images start piling up.<br>Design : I have a Halo White version; looks superb! Both at the back and front gives a brilliant look<br>Video Quality : There is an unnecessary sharpness for videos in medium/low quality; making the image look very unnatural. If previously you have been a SAMOLED user, like me , the video quality may disappoint you a bit. However when the resolution is high ie 720p+, the video quality on the whole phone gets too great!<br>Extension of the Camera at the back - This is one of the most irritating point in this phone; The camera's along with the fingerprint sensor rise a bit above the back's surface, even after i applied the cover, because of this you cant keep the phone anywhere you want. Mostly i keep the phone over a small cloth.<br>MIUI : Superb!<br>Heating : Does get a bit heated up when charging or playing game for a very long time<br>Hotspot feature : There is no limit or monitoring on the devices that can be connected to this phone. So, upon setting a password, it automatically connects-disconnects-connects-disconnects on any random device in near range, which can be quite frustrating.<br>Ads : Though i already had blocked the Ads option initially , when i started using the phone; but still i receive some ads from some of the inbuilt apps.<br>Network issues : No issues faced till now<br>Hence overall its a good phone to buy with minor set backs;  a really good option if need your phone to be good in the  gaming department.</span>",One person found this helpful

Saahil C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Review based on 1 Month Use,Reviewed in India on 22 January 2020,<span>I would not recommend you to buy this phone.<br>Phone camera is good in lights only but not good at all in low light mode.<br>Sound is very low. And Sound quality is very poor.<br>Performance wise is would rate it 2/5 it's hangs alot and games like Pubg are not fun to play on this phone.<br>Phone feels bulky and heavy overall body could have been better.<br>It comes with a lot of pre loaded apps you cannot uninstall them and they consume a lot of data all the time. It's difficult to switch it off without compromising the phone's overall performance.</span>,
Jatin ‚úîÔ∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,Under 15k is totally worth it...!,Reviewed in India on 16 January 2020,"<span>All said and done, Redmi Note 8 Pro is an impressive device and offers great value for money at its selling price. It raises the performance bar in the 15-20K category courtesy of its unlikely hero, the Mediatek Helio G90T SoC. The system and graphics performance are excellent at this price point and probably the best you can get with any chipset south of the Snapdragon 845. The photography department is more than decent and can get even better if some of the chinks are ironed out through software updates. While I had the 6GB variant.<br>But to state it simply, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is better than the Realme XT in terms of sheer performance, gaming included. Their cameras are evenly matched in terms of specifications and image quality both, and so are their aesthetics.</span>",
Shilpi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing camera quality üå∏,Reviewed in India on 16 March 2020,"<span>The best budget phone under 20k . Have been using this smart phone since a month now &amp; I can't deny the fact that it has amazing camera quality . 64M.P is worth it at the price you are paying for this mobile , even the macro camera is so lit . The details of 64 M.P are so clear while zooming in, even if you click  at very low light places the results are just wooow !!  .<br>Touch quality is so smooth . It has inbuilt Alexa which makes this device more special. You can ask alexa to play you songs , weather updates &amp; what not.<br>The dark mode which is  ' I'm fan of ' , is another amazing quality of this phone.  The HD quality of screen is another  amazing thing I loved about this mobile.<br>The only drawback about this mobile is it's battery life which drains quickly but it can be managed by turning on battery saver.<br>If I had to rate it overall , I'll rate it 9/10.</span>",

Sridhar T,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone with all aspects covered at less budget.,Reviewed in India on 7 December 2019,"<span>Honest review after using heavily with note 8 pro.<br><br>Pros:<br>1) Camera picture quality with good light settings delivers hq images.<br>2) No heating issues as others mentioned. Did ping for 3 hours. I had a phone case covered dint notice any heat.<br>3) Battery life lasts for 2 days without much gaming. With heavy usage it will be one day..<br>4) phone call, network quality is great. Value for money<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Phone is heavy, making it carry uncomfortable to hold for messaging and other purpose. Let down. Heavier compared to previous version.<br>2) Speaker and head phone jack kept at the bottom. While gaming, you tend to cover the speaker with your hands. Head phone jack could have kept at the top.<br>3) Low light camera doesn't offer good quality.<br>4) Big phone and uncomfortable to carry in pant pockets.</span>",
GK,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent enough,Reviewed in India on 18 January 2020,"<span>You should go for the non pro version as there is no spectacular advantage in owning this particular version. Save the extra bucks for a year phone bill instead. Don't expect to hold it as it is as its too slippery owning to heavy weight and glass surfaces in either sides. The fast charge is a gimmick. Camera output is pretty good but not the best. Display is quite dismaying, particularly when you been using AMOLED for a long while. But overall its a decent phone, yet not the best.</span>",One person found this helpful
Prashant,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better options are available,Reviewed in India on 26 February 2020,"<span>Review after 1 month: The phone hasn't disappointed me with anything. I had to buy this urgently because my previous phone was dead. Otherwise I would have opted for the Realme X2 or the Poco X2 which launched after I purchased this. This one is pretty good but as I mentioned above, there are better options. Battery life is good. Easily lasts a day. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge from 10%. Performance has been superb and multitasking, seamless. Camera quality is average. Don't believe the 64 MP camera hype. Display is big and very good even though it's an LCD display. The phone does get warm but nothing to make you uncomfortable. All in all, it's a good purchase but not the best one in this price bracket. Consider other ones if your budget is around 15k.</span>",

I worked in low salary job with the only aim to buy this guy one day!! I was confused between Realme and this one but let me tell you what I found during my endless research, ""Redmi Offers you what Realme is offering in less price.""<br><br>Maybe it's because the launch delay and the competition between the two. I had Redmi Note 3 before this and it's perfectly fine except of battery drain out and lack of storage. I was thinking of trying Realme but nope! Same thing in less price who doesn't want that?<br><br>My focus while looking for a phone was a better camera and TONS of storage.<br><br>SO,<br><br>Things That I Liked:)<br><br>It has amazing camera!<br>Dedicated SD card slot with dual sim!<br>THE COLOUR!!! aka Gama Green!<br>The processor and all that stuff that I don't understand but experts say is great!<br><br>Things that I don't like:(<br><br>The cameras and fingerprinting sensors are bulking OUT! that makes my ocd brain worry  A LOT for the lens! the camera is important because ai love nature's photography.<br><br>Tooooo many in built mi related apps that are just waste of storage and are not that useful! I would use mi store if it had everything that a Playstore has but it doesn't, so it's useless.<br><br>These things are livable but I hope they consider improving it to make the best!<br><br>Thanks Redmi for making affordable phones.</span>",

Narayan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"best phone under 15k , great performance and 64mp camera",Reviewed in India on 18 December 2019,"<span>i wanted this phone before diwali but quick delivery was not available, sed life for me tho i recieved it a day after diwali... the phone is awesome overall, yes you might get slower charging,heating issues while playing heavy games but they're not so problematic you can adjust.... also the quad camera is just a marketing term, just the main sensor and telephoto sensors are worthy, ultra wide and macro lens quality is bad enough to make you avoid using that slo mo works fine ... also we can try some unofficial builds/mods of Gcams in this device for great photos ...fingerprint reader is in a bit wrong place but fast enough, camera bump is noticeably large , battery life is equal to  phones having 4k mAh batteries under 20k (in order words back up is similar to phones having budget chipset and 4k mAh batteries) g90t consumes more power</span>",

Rajat Sharma,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for money..couldn't ask for anything else. Go for it.,Reviewed in India on 29 January 2020,"<span>At the given price, we couldn't ask for anything more than what this phone offers, but there are a few flaws which needs to be highlighted too.<br><br>1. The vibration alert is literally very less, and I often miss several calls. It's difficult to realise while walking on a quiet road, and impossible while riding a bike. The speakers are also just okay, and again, feels inadequate to hear the ringtones while in a noisy environment. So be prepared for it if you spend a lot of your time while out there in the traffic.<br><br>2. The camera specs looks great on the paper, but are totally overrated. Forget about zooming into your 64MP photographs and getting the flawless details which the company was boasting of. During normal usage, the camera produces good photographs, while the 2x zoom is useless. Also, the ultra-wide shot loses several details, so there wouldn't be any point in clicking a noisy photograph. Low light performance is just okay with loss of details, but not satisfactory. Rest assured, if you're in properly lit environment and the subject is right in front of you, the camera is surely going to produce some very good photographs.<br><br>3. The battery life is okay for max 1.5 days of normal usage.<br><br>4. The LED indicator on the top is quite dim and wouldn't get your attention unless you look for it.<br><br>5. The screen doesn't light up properly if you're out during the day and take out your phone to attend a call. You'll need to turn OFF the screen, and then again turn it ON by pressing the power button to see who's calling you.<br><br>6. The proximity sensor doesn't work properly after you're done with the phone call and want to disconnect the call. The screen wouldn't turn ON when you remove the phone from your ear. Again, you would've to press tbe power button twice to turn the screen ON again.<br><br>It surely is a phone with a great value for money, but Xiaomi shouldn't promote it like it's THE BEST one in the world, especially that 64MP camera. The quad camera setup needs better software integration for better performance I guess..</span>",

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding phone but for this massive lapse!!,Reviewed in India on 23 November 2019,"<span>I had bought the Mi Note 8 Pro for the first time on Nov 6, 2019. However, having set up the device I started facing issues with the headphone jack. Every single time I connected any Aux device to the phone, the connection was intermittently interrupted and the music/media would automatically pause for that reason, thus creating issues with continuous playback.<br>Pursuant to the same I got a replacement done and received a new device. However I am still facing the same connectivity issues with the Aux jack with no immediate remedy in sight. It seems most probably a software issue, however quite disappointing to have to face this on a new Mi device. Perhaps and hopefully the same may get remedied with future updates.<br><br>Coming to the rest of the phone, it is simply great for the price bracket that it belongs to. Would have given a top rating had I not faced the said issue over and over again.</span>",One person found this helpful

Anirban Dey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Network Issues.,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,"<span>The phone is an overall hit but if you are planning to use it on Wifi frequently the device has some issues,  as of low speed of internet while using the wifi. I have a 50Mbps plan but then it is unable to browse Instagram or twitch etc. Do not waste your money based on the youtube reviews as this device didn't even receive android 10 updates till date. After 3 months of usage, all I can say is that try other available options. The heating issues are resolved after some updates but then the wifi issues are still persisting.<br>The issue for wifi was checked across numerous devices but only the note 8 pro had the speed issues. MI doesn't give a  damn about their old device as they are busy launching the new one.</span>",

sidhant verma,4.0 out of 5 stars,Read before buy....,Reviewed in India on 14 February 2020,<span>Processor is pretty good but heating of the phone is on another level . I am writing this in winter think about in summer how much will it heat maybe they give an update or something so the heating got some less. Phone have no issue but camera quality is not that good. And in this price they must give ips display . But the display size is big and fully notch from corner to corner. Apps load very quickly. I have 8 gb and 4.8gb was always in used don't know why.? If you are buying for gaming its very good but in pubg sometimes it shut off immediately without any warning sign and that's sucks. Fingerprint is definitely fast and face id also.</span>,One person found this helpful

Vinod Gupta,4.0 out of 5 stars,Casting feature and service needs improvement,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2020,"<span>The phone has almost all the feature which one can expect. It has much space, fast mobile charging, fingerprint sensor, quickly face recognize, Alexa, Google Assistant, Screen Recorder, Nice cameras, Good look and feel.<br><br>Few things needs to be considered more -<br>1. Casting feature needs improvement, the mobile screen does not get cast directly. Tried all the way even by connecting the mobile and TV with same WIFI. I wrote to Redmi service twice but they did not respond at all. Casting only work from Google Photo and YouTube application directly and that too lagging in voice and picture.<br>2. Too much MI applications preinstalled, you may need to remove them once you receive the phone.<br>3. Whatever app you install, all those are put on desktop. There is nothing where Apps are put inside and only shortcuts are put on home screen.</span>",

Nicholas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good hardware and quality from Xiaomi,Reviewed in India on 27 November 2019,"<span>Phone comes in with Android 9 and MiUI 10. Latest update to MiUi 11. Good camera and Ads can be disabled while booting the phone for the first time. Full HD+ Display Res could have been much better. PPI is reduced to 395 when compared to the redmi note 7 pro which had 409, doesn't make a huge difference but adjusts to full brighteness in daylight. Fingerprint is really spot on and fast. Apps load in quick and RAM management is pretty good. Have been using it for more than 2 weeks. Call quality is good and battery is pretty good, 18W charger and charges completely from 0-100 in 1:50 hrs. I get two complete days of battery backup on frequent browsing and operating the phone. Also comes in with the lasted RAM and UFS storage. Gorilla glass 5 front and back. Only disadvantage is that the phone weighs close to 200 gms and feels heavier on single hand usage. Camera is decent and if you are a professional photographer you can switch over to Pro mode. Overall a satisfied and good purchase for a budget phone.</span>",
samama abubaker,4.0 out of 5 stars,Feel the premium phone.,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2019,"<span>Iam using this phone since 3 week I personally liked this phone.Because in the 20k segment this phone is a beast. Iam a heavy user I used this phone mostly for gaming purpose, and also photography<br>Literally i play pubg for more than 4 hours daily with the graphics settings of(HDR + ULTRA) and also with (Smooth + Extreme)<br>In this settings I don't faced any lag. But but in (HDR + ULTRA) I faced frame drops below 15 FPS.<br>But in the case of (Smooth+ Extreme) we can play upto 60FPS. But in some places like when we (hotdrop) mean if we surrounded with many enemys then the FPS will dropped below 45FPS.<br>But all-over the gaming experience is good.<br>But Also in the higher graphics setting the phone gets heated upto 40 degree that not a big problem because it will cool down immediately after putting phone idle for 2-3 minutes. So the liquid cooling helps to reduce the temperature fastly.<br><br>PROS:<br>1:The battery life of the is good if you are a light user then it will runs upto 2and a half day for a heavy user the battery will last upto 1 day.<br>2: The design of this phone is really amazing and also in the hand it will feel like a premium phone.<br>3: Both the front and the back is protected with the gorilla glass 5.<br>4: This phone has a LED notification light and also it has a ir blaster which I personally liked it.<br>5: All-over the gaming experience is smooth in this phone.<br>6: The 64mp camera will takes a good photos.<br>7: The front 20mp shooter is also pretty good.<br>8: A bigger screen of 6.53 inches.which provides a better experience in gaming.<br>9: IP52 rating for dustproof and splash proof.<br>10: This phone has a good processor Helio G90T. The score of this phone is above 282k.<br><br>CONS:<br>1: The speaker quality is below average.<br>2: The Brightness of this phone low.<br>3: Company should provide the super amoled display.<br>4: video recording of this phone is very poor.<br>5: While gaming at highest graphics the phone will started heating.<br>6: The camera bump is too big if we put a back case on it then also it will not cover the camera bump.<br>7: fingerprint sensor is too small and also the placement of the fingerprint sensor is bit wrong.<br>8: 4g connectivity support in 2019 end. This may be issue for future 5g network.</span>",One person found this helpful

Kiran K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,My experience with Note 8 Pro,Reviewed in India on 25 January 2020,"<span>Being using for a week. Below is my experience with the phone.<br>Pros<br>*Design<br>*Processor. G90T is great. No much heating as rumoured.<br>*Ram and storage for the price<br>*Display. Though not Amuled but they have tweaked it well with HDR. So no fuzz about display quality.<br>*Fingerprint and face unlock.Both are very quick.<br>*Camera, though not a great user of Camera but when i compared with my old Oneplus 5t it is crisp and details are good. You get quad cam with 64M sensor from Samsung. Bit of tweak has to be done to make it more better through software update.But overall better than others in that price segment.<br><br>Cons: This is not exactly an issue but i would like to give a heads-up<br>* Miui OS, this runs on top of Android. But if you are looking for stock like feel. You will be disappointed. You can do workaround like i installed Poco launcher which replicated similar to stock feel. You have to also get rid of Ads.<br>*Weight of the phone. I felt lill bulky with 200gms.<br>*L1 certification. Cannot watch Netflix or Prime with HD. You have to be satisfied with standard definition. Xaiomi claims to fix this in Q(10) update.<br><br>Finally it all boils down to price. If any other phone beats this with better features go for it. But for now i guess this is the better option available.  What you pay is what you get....</span>",

Better it should have been at front.<br>Camera Quality:<br>This phone is advertised as camera phone but if you compare details in pictures like leafs, sky this phone lacks some where. In low light images apear good but pixels quality decrease.

kaushal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,"<span>Probably the best phone in this price range. Pro's and con's are as follows.<br><br>Pro's : 1) Powerful Mediatek Helio G90T. No less than a flagship processor. You can easinly play all high end graphics games without any lag on high settings. PUBG Mobile is buttery smooth on HDR + ULTRA frame rate.<br>2) Camera : Primary camera performs well for the price range. 64 Megapixel works perfectly but struggles in indoor lighting conditions. Selfi camera performs well.<br>3) Battery : 4500 mAh battery works perfectly. Device gets full charged from 10% within one hour given conditions that internet,wifi,bt should be turned off and device not being used while charging.<br>4) finger print reader works fine. It will work 8 or 9 times out of 10. For me, it even forks if I have a bit moisture on my finger.<br>5) Build quality : Corning Gorilla glass 5 works exceptionally well. I've accidentally dropped my phone from 3 -4 feet height a couple of times without back cover and it didn't get a single scratch.<br>6) AI mode in camera app gives you best results most of the times.<br>7) Design elements : I think this is relative term. Few people will like the design and some may not. I personally like it.<br>8) IPS panel with hdr+ works very good. Viewing angles are great.<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Wide angle camera is only usable for properly lighen up places. Low light conditions add huge amount of colour noise. Macro camera is of no use at all. Atleast for me. Picture quality is poor. They should've given zoom lens instead of that.<br>2) HEATING ISSUES : they have mentioned it comes with liquid cool technology but I personally didn't feel any use of it. Device gets heat up near upper left corner on the back side while heavy usage.<br>3) Device gets heatup quickly while recording 4k or 60 fps videos. After recording for 15 mins (Not continuously) in the afternoon it got heated up and system restricted camera operations due to overheating.<br>It gets heat up while playing games on high settings as well. But I am glad it doesn't affect performance but sometimes it becomes really uncomfortable to hold the heated device.<br>4) Game turbo : Game turbo works fine but it has a major issue. It comes with a game dnd but I don't know why it doesn't restrict popup notifications. It doesn't even has an option to turn off pop-up notifications while playing games. If you're using 3 or 4 finger claw while playing pubg, you'll atleast once or twice accidentally tap all those annoying pop-up notifications while playing game.<br>5) Face Unlock : Face unlock works fine but has an issue. It unlocks the phone even if you're not looking in the camera. This should be fixed in an update asap.<br>6) No regular updates : No wonder it comes with MIUI so, you have to get used to late updates. I've brought this phone in the December last year, now it's june and it still has December security patch, didn't receive any updates.<br>7) Comes with bloatware as usual in all Redmi phones.<br><br>Overall device has given me good results in past 6 months of usage. I would say it WAS a value for money device when it was priced ‚Çπ14,999. Now the prices are increased by around 1.5k, it's still a very good price for this device but 1.5k is a huge price hike.</span>",

Very late delivery ( 7days) , that's too long<br>Only 1 reputed seller so go buy it from mi store<br>2. Alexa not that efficient, maybe because of the device or internet. Not sure yet.<br>Doesn't work as good as the other Amazon echo dot products. Maybe that's why it's not available in note 9 pro<br>3.

Especially 64 mp camera that's really awesome, it's actually work. Looks stunning in all glass body. Processor work pretty good, while play PUBG feel no frame drop. Gives almost all day battery life.

The Salvedad,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the ""Beast"" in every expect i expected.",Reviewed in India on 6 March 2020,"<span>everything is just fine. some things that i hate about this phone is that the video quality in room lighting and in night is worst like its 5mp camera it's just pathetic. daylight camera is good video is good although 4k recording is useless unless you use a stand to mount your phone on it's too shaky cuz lack of EIS.<br>battery life is bad for a 4500mah battery.<br>screen is good expect for the fact the video streaming on youtube really sucks like reallyy you'll hate it if you stream youtube alot although if you watch on 720p then no problem but im now used to it i don't see much difference. color reproduction of the screen is bad, black color find it difficult to make it's way out of ther colors viewing angles are fine but not okay for this price point.<br>but when it comes to Gaming. this is some serious business, i must say this device has a lot of potential in performance. it's packed with latest g90t processor which makes pubg mobile more fascinating. you can play HDR on ultra frame rate for about 1 hour after that you can notice little bit frame drops but if you play on smooth and extreme frame rate which i think is the best option you'll notice that the game runs like water really smooth.<br>Heating issue is not that much, after playing 3 matches it'll start to heat a little bit on back top corner but it's unnoticeable if you have a cover on the phone and the phone doesn't heat at all if you don't play games on it.</span>",

""Ok"" not ""superb""",Reviewed in India on 4 December 2019,"<span>After one month of usage writing this review as a normal mobile user ( am not a photographer, gamer, techie)<br>Pros:<br>1. Fast charging. in 4500mah its charges quite fast. i liked it<br>2. Selfie camera was good<br>3. Rear camera, portrait mode was good. Manual adjustment of blur is good. AI camera option is there<br>4. Battery life: For normal use (only watsapp, youtube, small games, call) its coming around 1 and half days.<br>5. Fingerprint reader, face unlock works really fast.<br>6. 128gb and expandable is superb<br>Other than this all common things are there no need to mention that.<br>CONS:<br>1. Since it is 6.5 inch its looks too big in hand. For small hand people it will dificult to handle , handling top notification clusters is quite difficult.<br>2. Lock, vloume button : Reaching those buttons with fingers is difficult. It will take time to used to it<br>3. 64mp camera didnt give any impression looks like  normal pic only. ( Realme XT camera was too good, i have compared photos of these two devices)<br>4. 960fps slow motion video is for 10 secs only and u cant edit<br>5. In camera app, orientation changes not happening fast. You have to shake 2 to 3 times to get correct orientation.<br>6. Call sound was too high person who sits near u can hear .<br>7. For heavy user batter will drain fast because, for 6.5 inch mobile 4500 mah battery not enough. Daily u have to keep for charging.<br>8. It is 200g after u put covers and all it will increase a bit so it feels heavy in your hand. also in pocket.<br>9. Gallery app i hate. after watchng a video its difficult to come to grid page. also Back-home button not appearing so easily so you have to mess up with it sometime.<br>10. Mostly am using in one handed mode. In Full mode when i use watsapp fingers got pain. In one hand u cant reach top of the mobile so easily.<br>11. Built in alexa voice capture is not clear.<br>12. Mainly....... i didnt have much data since its my new mobile. i didnt install much app. i faced mobile hangs for some time. It took time to open camera app, closing some other app. What is the use of 6GB RAM.<br><br>Verdict:<br>Before i was using REDMI note 4. i tot of going for Samsung M30s, but last minute i bought this. I have to compare with note 4 only, so for me Its ok to buy but dont expect wow factor here reg battery, performance, handling, camera. For look wise its good but still if we put cover no looks matter here. Go for it if you are a normal user.</span>",
Deepak,4.0 out of 5 stars,A decent phone at a decent price.,Reviewed in India on 12 May 2020,"<span>Redmi note 8 pro, the pictures and the videos don't do justice to how good this phone looks. After 2 days of use I  feel this phone has a great potential. In this price range this is a good phone I am an MI user I was using MI A1 bought it in 2017 December and it still works amazing, this time I wanted to go back to apple or buy some other phone but my wife suggested me this one and clearly she was not wrong. Gamers you won't be disappointed turbo mode makes your gaming seamless and the battery will take it, doesn't heat as much as some  videos say. , yea I have had some issues with 2nd space  but deleting that would be fine. If you are thinking of buying this for Camera, please don't though the camera is good but not as good as other phones have at the same price range but if you want to buy it for other purposes daily use etc this will do you complete justice.</span>",

Day 1st itself it start heated up followed by hanging up.The technician *Swagat* and his technician supervisor *Nirlepta* were completely  helpless and rose their hands up and said I have to use that phone only.Its a pure feeling where my saved 18000rs. Has been dumped in garbage by Amazon and their reprentative doesn't understand the customer queries. Insensible staff who cannt resolve the real issue and insisted me to use that faulted phone only.Staff doesn't have good listening skills, they were not permitting the customer to finish their talk, I think interrupting other person  is their policy.And eventually ended up by bounding me to use that phone only. When I requested him to transfer my call to supervisor, got such a silly answer that they don't follow such hierarchy.If this is what they amazon is, I think uninstalling the app will be the best solution so that henceforth I won't throw my money in garbage.Massive thanks to Swagat and Nirlepta for teaching a great lesson.<br><br>Truly pathetic service by Amazon.</span>",

PRAVEEN HAVALDAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone under 18k - mid range segment,Reviewed in India on 23 January 2020,"<span>After experiencing all features of this phone. I would suggest to buy this phone Redmi note 8 pro. Best phone in mid range segment. 18k bucks and you will have the best phone in your hand. Camera quality - front n back are awesome. Compared with iPhone 8 and one plus 6 camera. Far better picture quality than iphone n oneplus 6. Xiaomi manufactued a best phone for pubg lovers too. It's best for playing pubg, call of duty, free fire, Asphalt car racing. No lag issue. Good phone themes by Xiaomi. Good user interface, good processor. Plz don't compare this phone with ""one plus 7"". One plus comes under premium segment phones and redmi note 8 pro comes under mid range segment. So level of bench markings for both phones is different. I would suggest to go n buy this phone if your budget is maximum 20k. Thanks Amazon for super fast delivery.</span>",

Totally satisfied!<br><br>Edit 1 (7 June 2020): I purchase one more phone from this range, the one with 8 GB +128 GB variant in black colour.<br><br>There are a lot of reviews out there saying it has heating problem. This phone heats a little beside the camera. But trust me, the battery backup of this phone is amazing. It lasts for 5 hours when I play pubg continuously.<br><br>Go for it without a doubt!<br><br>Hint (for people comparing this phone with Redmi Note 9 Pro Max): If you're thinking of comparing Redmi Note 8 Pro with Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, then please go for the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max because it has as Octa Core Processor Snapdragon 720G in which 6 cores are of 1.8 GHz and other two cores are of 2.3 GHz.<br><br>There is a lot of confusion going on in the market.

App launching time is really fast<br>2)Full hd display is really good. ultra thin bezels give a premium look.<br>3)since it has a gaming processor, GPU is awesome pubg, cod mobile runs at ultra hd butter smooth<br>4) battery life is good enough, even after heavy gaming and continuous usage of facebook, youtube with data connection, lasts almost 1.5 days<br>5)camera has 960 fps slow motion video recording, macro lens, wide angle lens and the 64 mp monster takes ultra high quality images, even after zooming in u can see all tiny details clearly. selfie cam is also nice. photo taken in complete darkness with flash on is not at all grainy<br>6)6gb ram can handle heavy games and multiple apps simultaneously. Heavy games like asphalt9, cod dont relaunch after minimising and launching other apps like fb, youtube, chrome<br>7)phone doesnt heat much while playing heavy games, even after 30 mins of intense gaming, the back of the phone is just mildly warm, but heats more when gaming while charging<br>Cons:-<br>1)screen size(6.53 inch) is big and difficult to use one handed<br>2)some people complain about bloatware and annoying ad notifications, but you can uninstall them</span>",

Daneya Dcosta,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Great Budget Phone with Good Features.,Reviewed in India on 2 March 2020,"<span>The Redmi Note 8 Pro is a great phone for the price tag.<br><br>The Camera is very good although rumours would suggest otherwise so don't believe in those. It is not flagship grade but for selfies and photography the camera is almost as good as a flagship phone.<br><br>The fingerprint reader is a problem since it is located near the camera, and unless you properly register your entire finger it can be a little problematic to unlock but once properly registered the scanner is definitely faster than the indisplay/optical fingerprint scanner.<br><br>The phone has a decent battery life and can last about 12 to 15 hours on heavy usage otherwise the battery lasts for 24 hours on normal use. Also this phone does not heat up under heavy use because of the Liquid cooling system inside.<br><br>Overall the phone is worth the price although the multitasking could be better and an Amoled Display or Oled Display would be better it is still a good phone until the next generation budget phone comes out.<br><br>4 out of 5 stars.</span>",

Mohamed Farook,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lost faith in Redmi forever!! REDMI is becoming an IRON BOX,Reviewed in India on 29 January 2020,"<span>I was a Redmi lover all this time. Now i am becoming a fan of Realme. Redmi phone has inbuilt iron box which heats up very badly. I was full of enthusiasm when getting Redmi note 8 pro. I thought 6GB RAm and 128 GB will handle everything smoothly. When i started the phone, it took atleast 15 minutes to load up the home screen. First impression was worst. Next i start getting Not responding message for some applications. Realme is more convenient to use, for example: if you turn up volume there is no way you can set ringtone to raise but in Realme you can set the volume button to your choice whether it will be music or ringtone. Likewise there are a lot of enhancements Redmi should work on. I am still waiting for the best Redmi phone which doesn't heat. Let's see if that wish of mine gets fulfilled in the years to come.</span>",

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good camera phone with not so good processor.,Reviewed in India on 5 March 2020,"<span>After Using this phone since 2 months.i would say.<br>1.The processor is not for gamers. It gets heaten up quickly.<br>2.Mediatek processor is not the right choice.<br>3.Camera is good. 64 mp camera is a good boost to its features.<br>4.the other cameras, wide angeled and macro are also good one.<br>5.battery life is Ok. Because of its hdr display battery drains a bit quicker. Moreover, mediatek processor also takes a lot of battery to work.<br>6. Howsoever, battery is 4500 mah which means it will definitely work the whole day and a half in a single charge.<br>7. Front camera is very nice. Very sharp images can be shot.<br>8. Video recording in hdr 1080 pixels, is nice to see.<br>9. Night mode camera is not up to the mark.<br>10. The design. - the glass body looks so premium and shiny . The only problem i have is with the protruding cameras behind. Why is it so i don't know. It hurts the cameras while placing on a table and so it hurts me.</span>",

Harsh Madhvi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Redmi Proves the Power Again,Reviewed in India on 6 January 2020,"<span>This phone from Redmi is a performance beast and I did not find any small lags in a regular usage but not found even a frame drop in heavy duty games like Shadowgun, PUBG, Call of Duty (all 3 with highest possible graphics).<br><br>Camera is superior to the most of the flagships out there in the market including S10, OP7T. Night mode is insane and the clarity will make you click more photos. 64MP mode is detail oriented and you get plenty of details in a jpg file of 20mb.<br><br>Selfie camera is awesome. Portraits are well captured and the features like studio effects makes selfies more attractive.<br><br>Fingerprint unlock is insanely fast and I have never seen such speed of unlocking in any other smartphone out there as on date.<br><br>Face unlock is also no short of bang on target, regardless of lighting conditions. (Be it bright day, pitch dark, extremely low light with shaking hand (being the car), side face).<br><br>The good thing about face unlock is that it will work only when your eyes are open (means one can not simply unlock your device while you are sleeping)<br><br>Battery is also good, day to day usage will reduce batter very gradually. Standby loss is 2% between 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. but I found the drainage bit faster while playing games. Hope to get this fixed in updates.<br><br>Screen is not AMOLED but believe me, you will not regret for that. Redmi has implemented HDR Compliant screen which works extremely well with YouTube, Netflix, Prime, HotStar and many other apps that I may not know.<br><br>Colors are punchy and sunlight view is more than comfortable.<br><br>Design is very attractive.<br><br>Overall (5/5)</span>",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Package in A Budget,Reviewed in India on 12 June 2020,"<span>For a 4050 mAh battery, this phone works throughout the day and could continue for more than 24 hours. I am a heavy user and stay out of the house for longer hours, so I need a heavy battery phone and this works great for me. The camera (both front and back) is really amazing and I'd say it is better than an iPhone. It's really smooth, especially when I played PUBG initially, I was like, ""Wow! This is super smooth."" I love gaming and sometimes I play for hours. And this was up to the mark although it got heated up a bit around the camera, but that's where the processor is I guess, so it's justified. That's not a big issue though because it cools down fast as well. The storage is really nice, it works perfect. There were some apps I didn't need like Opera Mini, so I uninstalled it. I love androids because they come in with great themes, and MI themes are wonderful. I like playing with the themes and fonts and all, and this is really nice. I love the MIUI 11 update. Plus in this phone, you can use it in a full screen mode that allows you to remove the footer which has the home button, back button and the recents tray. That is similar to the iOS themes. It gets charged really quick. The original charger that comes with the phone in the box is great. Obviously, there is no earplugs or earphones with the phone. Instead, you get a nice soft cover with this. I ordered a ""Shadow Black"" phone and it came in with a translucent black back cover. I don't know if they provide same colour covers or transparent ones with the others.</span>",

Swatantra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for Money,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2019,"<span>This phone provides an awesome value at its price. The phone looks and feels premium a bit heavy just because of that 4500 mah battery but it feels a lot heavier than it actually is just because of it's weight is more on the bottom side. Now the cameras it has a great versatile camera setup on the back but i feel the ultrawide shots could have been better also the night mode does not have any details just because it is just increasing the iso too much to compensate for low light however google camera makes things better. Talking about google camera lets talk about development for the mediatek helio G90t processor that's powering up the show, the chip is excellent be it gaming or regular day to day task G90t blazes through everything. Also there are many good Gcams available for this device but no custom roms as of now, however Xiaomi is trying a lot to make things better. And the display that is i feel the most interesting part of this device i compared the display of this device with realme Xt's display to be very honest i feel the colors are a bit better on redmi while the contrast of that amoled pannel is just awesome on XT but the HDR video playback supports makes things a bit better but still those inky blacks are just awesome. Also the bezels are very thin on this device so much that while watching a youtube video you sometimes skip the video just because your hand was touching the display. But overall the device is Excellent but could have been better.</span>",

MurtyIN,3.0 out of 5 stars,Speaker and backside part quality is not good,Reviewed in India on 4 January 2020,"<span>I purchased this with my Note 5 Pro(Used just 1 yr 2 months only). With Note 8 Pro, when dialing a number (holding the phone in hand), am feeling the vibration at the back side and all 4 sides of the phone. Whereas, this is not there with my Note 5 Pro mobile. Even same with while talking. It seems, the back side material quality is not good or not placed sufficient space. The vibrating will irritate. Speaker sound is low as compare with Note 5 Pro. In my opinion, if your old phone condition is good, don't buy this. Even wifi capturing is also not good. I'm getting below 3 Mbps with 200 mbps speed whereas with Note 5 Pro am getting 50+ mbps speed.

Samson Gadamandla,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome as expected,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019,<span>Upgraded myself from mi note 4 to mi note 8 pro. Found few positive and negotiate the n this mobile...first positive points is it's battery as really it Stay longer with one time charge for entire day and touch screen response is improvised and camera picture density is good. Now negative points.... due to gorilla glass 5 we have to increase brightness to 75% compared to mi note 4 at 40% to get smart screen brightness and camera picture colour and brightness is less compared to mi note 4 and most problem facing is audio quality when earphones connected as same earphones used for note 4 the quality is so bad that even after making arguments with EQ and installed base booster app doesn't help to fix. As Mi gives mostly the best and few small problems that are expected to be fixed in next software update.</span>,

Though you have to wait for sell, it's worth it. Redmi has issued all it's problems. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly in the same time as on other flagships. Camera quality is too good. You will find the difference once you compare. Battery life which the most important has not disappointed. Most importantly the gaming experience is the best.

MG,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Too low volume on speaker, makes it a bad product",Reviewed in India on 31 December 2019,"<span>Sound/volume is very low. Even if you boost its volume fully it's too low. If you wanna watch movie on Amazon prime turning on its speaker and the phone is right in front of you the volume is too low that you cannot enjoy. Anither point I have observed manyt one is that whenever I am on a conference internet call and if by chance you get a normal voice call in between whether I receive or decline it, after that the volume of the conference call gets too low that you cannot hear anything in speaker.</span>",One person found this helpful

Very well packed,, thanks to the courier partner..<br>Now coming to the specs of the phone.. The phone is just awesome &amp; it goves brilliant outcomes.. The camera is fantastic, just wow... I just loved it.. I was lucky enough to get an 8 gb+ 128 gb variant by exchanging my redmi note 6 pro &amp; paying more 12.4k.. The processor is on another level.. No wonder redmi gives a tough competition to any other smartphones in todays market.. I play high end games at high graphics &amp; frame rate is just awesome.. I get 60 fps at highest speed anyone could ever imagine..the best smartphone in the market.The camera has too many modes including portrait,,panorama, night mode &amp; pro modes respectively.. The video also got some cool features such as slow motion,, super slow motion &amp; short videos.. But you cannot expect video cordings at higher frame rates &amp; also it applies to the slow &amp; super slow motion..<br>All in all a great smartphone for gaming, camera &amp; processor..

Yash Sharma,3.0 out of 5 stars,Unsatisfactory battery life,Reviewed in India on 1 January 2020,"<span>The mobile phone is an excellent budget phone with an excellent fingerprint scanner and camera, but what it lacks in is the battery life. The battery drains very fast when we switch on internet and use it. Also, the battery consumed by the UHD screen and it's alexa app is also very high. The auto-brightness is also not helpful for reduction in battery-drain for it does lower brightness to such low extent in comparison to ambient light so that screen becomes barely visible. However, the ""reading mode"" and ""battery saver' are the modes which i found a bit useful. The ""so-called"" 4500 mAH powerful battery is not at all good.<br><br>However, excluding battery life and excessive heating issues on this phone, i liked everything else in this phone including camera, looks, and all. More or less it is a nice budget mobile phone.</span>",

At first i thought it may be phone signal issue at a location but now i see this happening frequently irrespective of location.<br>2) With bluetooth turned on, Wifi speed will reduce drastically. You can not use bluetooth and wifi together. I have to download music, videos offline then only i can switch to my bluetooth handset to watch it.<br><br>I do not know if this can fixed by any software update or is it a hardware issue.

Abhishek Bose,3.0 out of 5 stars,Beast in the budget... But,Reviewed in India on 26 February 2020,<span>Performs exceptionally well. Mediatek G90T gives a smooth performance and can easily get you 60FPS while playing PUBG. And can handle day to day work easily and can handle anything you throw at it. But the major deal-breaker can be that Xiaomi doesn't send MIUI updates frequently since Snapdragon chipsets get more frequent updates.<br><br>I have been using the phone now for 4 months straight and i have received only one update which eas so called MIUI 11 based on Android 9.

Amzad Ansari,4.0 out of 5 stars,Paisa wasool,Reviewed in India on 22 January 2020,"<span>Probably this is the most beautiful looking phone in this price range, no other brand is even close. But, it has few drawbacks of it's own, battery life being one of them. You expect at least a day and half with 4500 mAh pack,but lasts just one day at most.  Some pre-installed apps can not be removed and that's a bummer. Finger print is fast and accurate, no complaints in that department. Camera is good, not exceptional, but again for the asking price it's better than the competitors. It has some water resistant rating, which is very thoughtful from Redmi, couldn't have asked for more.<br>All in all satisfied with the look and performance.</span>",

It was very good experience shopping with you'll. Wanted to give this phone has a Christmas gift to my mom. I could give this gift to my mom exactly on 25th December is only because of your quick service.<br>Now, lets talk about the performance of this phone<br>1) Processor: Very good and no lagging.<br>2) Camera : Don't known about others, but in my case I am happy with its pic quality. The only drawback is that it has a protruding surface on the back of the phone. So whenever you keep there are chances that you are keeping the phine on the lens, so to solve this problem i bought a thick cover<br>3) Battery life: Battery life is ok, I think this processor consumes more battery than snapdragon processor.<br>Overall it is a very good phone at this price. Just go for it and you won't get disappointed.</span>",

Rishav Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class at this Price Segment..,Reviewed in India on 30 December 2019,"<span>1) MIUI 10 doesn't seem to be as riddled with bloatware and apps as was the case with her Redmi Note 4 (which was an ad minefield). Most of the extra apps can be uninstalled.<br><br>2) The presence of system ads also seems to have gone down a lot compared to her Note 4. I did a debloat and uninstalled unwanted software like Mi Music using ADB, and disabled all the recommendations in the remaining apps, disabled App Scanning (pointless) and it seems to be really clean now. Only some essential Google apps remain. This process hardly takes 10 minutes at the most. There is a java utility in XDA by Saki that really helps with the debloat! Thanks a million for this!<br><br>3) The phone seems to be really snappy and quick. No heating observed while charging.<br><br>4) Seems to be built really well. The phone has a nice heft to it. Power and volume buttons are quite tactile and feel good. The Gamma Green color is a looker (this is coming from someone who hates gradient colors and has a strong preference for matte black and greys)<br><br>5) Screen is pretty good, actually. Colors are pleasant and blacks are as good as an LCD can manage. Contrast also seems to be good. No complaints. Chose an LCD equipped phone on purpose.<br><br>6) Comes bundled with an 18W charger and a transparent case.<br><br>7) There is a noticeable camera bump at the back which is super annoying to me. The included case doesn't make it flush. A tiny part is still sticking out. Ordered a Nillkin frosted shield case which has additional clearance for the hump and offers more protection.<br><br>8) Relatively consumer friendly as it still has the good old 3.5 mm jack and a dedicated SD card slot.</span>",

Swayam Deep Dash,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Apple of Your Eye,Reviewed in India on 13 December 2019,"<span>The Redmi Note series has always set the bar when it comes to the mid-range smartphone territory.<br>And once again, as an overall package, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is competing in flagship level territory, especially when it comes to the specs.<br><br>*Design - 5/5*<br>The glass sandwich design makes the phone feel elegant and subtle unlike the tacky metal Redmi Notes of old. The Note 8 Pro has a sturdy heft in hand and doesn't feel very unbalanced in weight distribution. One handed usage is not exceptional, since it is a pretty big phone. The camera lens array looks well designed on the back and the White Colour variant looks really good. My pick would be the Gamma Green variant however, it really is something else. Buttons are a non-issue, and I particularly like this placement over Samsung's way. I do not see the need for the text ""64MP AI Super Camera"" on the back however, but it is barely visible. The included case is very good quality and a boon to have.<br><br>*Display - 4/5*<br>The LCD is display is vibrant and bright and does not suffer from the dullness issues that used to plague Xiaomi phones in the past. The screen is terrific for everyday usage as well as Media Consumption. My only gripe would be that it still pales in front of the AMOLED display on the Realme XT which has much more vibrant colours and battery efficiency.<br><br>*Performance &amp; Specs - 5/5*<br>There are really no complaints when it comes to specs. 6gb of RAM at this price point is simply a godsend and the USB-C port means this phone is 2019-ready. The Mediatek G90T SoC is a good performer in most day to day tasks and can handle heavy games at acceptable frame rates if you drop the settings down. It might be a bit worse than Qualcomm when it comes to open source work however, such as GCam ports and Custom OS's. The Haptic Motor is predictably bad.<br><br>*Battery - 5/5*<br>The 4500 mah battery eeks out almost 7 hours of Screen on Time on standard usage. Add to that the included fast charger in the box and this competes in flagship territory.<br><br>*Camera - 4/5*<br>The camera array here is definitely the best out there in this price point. It is insane how these mid-range smartphones can have a quad camera array while Google is still struggling to include two. The key difference between more competent camera phones and this however, is consistency.<br>While shots in the day time generally look excellent with good amount of detail, the Note 8 Pro often produces excessive noise in darker areas of the shot such as the highlights. Once the available light starts to go down, the more noise it produces in shots with the back camera - such as in the sky and in leaves of trees. But these shots are mostly - perfectly usable for social media.<br>What rectifies some of these issues is the Night Mode. Once Night Mode is used, the photos are generally more detailed and have much less noise.<br>Portrait Mode is generally very good.<br>The Telephoto lens works well, but the Ultrawide struggles to find focus and produces soft, sometimes hazy images. It is a tough angle to get right.<br>The Selfie Camera is very good. Switching off beauty mode works as expected and it shows good detail in human subjects. Skin tones are also fairly accurate and not too white.<br>There are a billion modes and the whole Camera UI can seem a bit overwhelming with the amount of features it has, some very stupid ones to boot. Video quality is good and the slow mo features are very nice to have. Super Slow Mo is very difficult to get right though and was a chore to time properly. Xiaomi loses some points for this cluttered Camera Application that has pretty lame stuff like filters, which you can anyways apply later within an editor before posting.<br><br>*Software - 3/5*<br>The Achilles heel of the Redmi Line - MIUI. There is a lot of bloatware that gets preinstalled onto the phone, which thankfully, can be uninstalled. MIUI has ads all over the place - please go through the setup process carefully and disable the user experience program to get rid of some of the ads. There is an article by Android Authority that can help you get rid of all the ads in MIUI, but it would be nice if we didn't have to deal with this in the first place.<br>No App Drawer, everything plopped onto the home screen in typical Apple Fashion. I was not a fan of this and installed Nova Launcher at the first opportunity, which worked without a hitch.<br>There are microstutters and jitters and lags occasionally across MIUI, not so much once Nova launcher has something to say about it.<br>The Settings Menu is confusing and suffers from poor translation. It lacks polish and the options are often poorly organized and overwhelming. While MIUI is chock full of features, it is slow to get updates and probably won't receive any more updates after Android 10.  The Gesture Navigation right now is not upto par with Android 10 fluidity and polish. If you buy this, you can't really be thinking along the lines of frequent updates and bug fixes.<br>Also, I could not get the Haptic feedback to work on GBoard, which is the default keyboard. This seems like a bug and is not nice to experience Day 1.<br><br>To Conclude - All the negatives listed are honestly nitpicking at what is a very good device at this price point. Xiaomi has indeed redefined what 15k brings you these days in Smartphone market. Suffice it to say that this is the Apple iPhone for people who still have two healthy, intact kidneys.</span>",

Handles very well<br><br>6. Awesome camera specially macro lens feature<br><br>7. Xiaomi has given a very beautiful cover with this phone, although it hides the back look of the phone<br><br>CONS<br>1. Battery back up not among the best but not bad either. My previous phone was MI MAX 2 and it stands nowhere near it in terms of battery. Would last 1 day on heavy usage<br><br>2. Slow Wifi Speed. Have compared with at least 3 phones and a laptop with the same broadband connection. (I have deducted 1 star specially for this problem)<br><br>3. Wifi and Bluetooth dont work well together.<br><br>4. I somehow felt the clarity of videos (downloaded HD movies) was not good as compared to my MI MAX 2 (almost same screen size)<br><br>My final verdict is that it's a great phone but don't expect it to be a perfect phone</span>",

You can find very minimal difference  if you come po are this display to Amoled..<br>.<br>I mainly record videos and do digital artworks...  It's video quality is fantastic and it record very high quality sound as well as screen is very smooth.. Previously I used realme3 which display was not sharp and also touch sensitivity is poor.. RN 8 pro's touch sensitivity is too good.. And  I can draw whatever I want flawlessly....<br>Only cons is that even 4500 mah battery can't hold a day if I play pubg 3-4 hour.. If you play pubg 2 hour and use normally than it's battery will last up to a day or 1and a half day..

CHANDRU,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor sound- every else is great,Reviewed in India on 14 December 2019,"<span>It all depends which phone you have used before buying this one. Not a premium mobile phone it's just realme 1. Major major drawback is audio is worst. Speaker is not good to ring in out station like when you are driving, or in the traffic, kept in pocket. Those who says sound is good are deaf or senseless listeners in point of music and sound quality. All Redmi phones are not giving us natural sound or quality sound. It gives the sound output that will be good only for cheap earphones (100rs ). I am music lover, used lenova, realme, swipe, Nokia, all mobiles sound was great means they don't ehnance the default sound output into bass enabled mode, But Redmi does it. I have changed all settings Equalizer, headphone type, changed 320kbps songs also but I didnot get what I wanted. You won't hear the isolated part of different instruments or music and voice even. Except sound this is best mobile, but sound matters me a lot. Over night I cloned my old (realme) phone to note 8 pro. And today I went outside and riding bike and walking in the street, believe me I kept full volume and vibrate. I received 9 missed calls in different times but I could not sense it because of the inadequate loudness. You don't go with this only if you are a music lover. Instag_chandru_chan93</span>",
Prabhu Keshari,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid overall package in the budget,Reviewed in India on 18 December 2019,<span>I am quite happy with it. Overall it's a good and recommended product. Battery backup and charging speed could have been better as compared to competition.  higher battery capacity is compansating  the power hungry mediatec processor.<br><br>Not sure if performance and battery backup remain same or become worst going by the time considering the Mediatec history.<br>Camera is good. Night mode photography can be improved.<br><br>Finger print speed is super fast.<br><br>HDR Display is good. L1 support is there but Netflix and Amazon videos are not playing in HD.<br><br>Overall day to day performer is very good. Not facing any lag issue.<br><br>There are some software bugs here and there. Needs to be fix in coming software update.</span>,

Franc ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed - Bad phone, Bad Camera",Reviewed in India on 26 November 2019,<span>I had an Asus selfie which was like 4 yrs old in a time when people chancge phone every year. The Asus had a good built inspite of dropping it multiple times. It had a good camera but low light pics would pixelate. I wanted an upgrade in the camera n hence opted for this phone.<br><br>The Redmi note 8 pro for 16k is not worth the camera for sure. The other features are good n serves the purpose. I would suggest to explore other options. This was my 1st MI buy n a big mistake.<br><br>Camera - It boasts of a quad camera but reality it's no where upto mark. In Selfie mode it doesn't offer same features. In low light the pics are bad and pixelate. The 64 Mp camera is slightly better but when blown up it pixelates. It's got a Samsung lens not sure if that's the reason. My previous Asus had better features. My friend had a Vivo with better light in low light mode.<br><br>Battery Life - the batter for now seems good. In 1 charge it works the whole day almost 8-10 hrs which is impressive @ 4500 mah .<br><br>Processor - it's got a media tek processor which is fast n smooth. I did like it compared to my previous phone. Im not into gaming so couldn't evaluate this better.<br><br>Design - the design is fine although the camera bulges out from the back. As the phone came with a cover it solved the purpose. The phone comes with a Gorilla glass which is good.<br><br>Storage - the storage is good at 128 GB and also has space for a memory card. That's helpful.<br><br>App - it has a lot of inbluilt apps which may not be necessary and useful.<br><br>I've compared this phone to Samsung M30s but that was similar so opted for this.</span>,

Its processor is a beast in this price range. But you will have to compromise with the Display. The Display quality of this phone is little bit dull and little considerable. But if you want a beast processor, camera, battery and charger in this price then definitely go for it. But if you can't compromise with the Display and want an average processor then go for Realme XT with Super AMOLED best Display. But this phone has its own value. It is a beast in this price range.

A 13mp camera of other phone is giving clear images than 64mp camera of redmi note 8 pro. Maybe be the issues would be resolved in future updates.<br>I am irritated with hotspot of redmi note 8 pro. The hotspot connecting to other phones but not connecting to PC (the PC condition is good and other phones are connecting). Its horrible if we get a half working hotspot with a phone of Rs. 13999.<br>It also lacking WPS entry option for wifi.<br>Speaker out put incase of audio and video is good.

Joseph ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely is worth the 16k.,Reviewed in India on 21 January 2020,"<span>I've been using the phone for about a week now, the battery life is awesome, using Netflix, playing games and chatting throughout the day, the battery last about 30 to 33 hours. (Until it's completely drained out)<br><br>Haven't experimented with the camera too much yet, but the output is pretty good, happy with it.<br><br>Like I read in most reviews, I do slip up between the camera and the finger print reader, but getting used to it already. The phone is on the heavier side, already managed to sleep off with the phone in my hand and have it fall on my face! And yeah it hurt!!<br><br>The volume output is not as loud as my precious phone but not a big deal. Love the dark mode feature! And the gamma green, more like a teal colour to my eyes is my favorite!</span>",
Abhinav Nandi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Currently the best all rounder phone money can buy in this range,Reviewed in India on 25 December 2019,"<span>This phone does feel way more premium than others in this range, looks at par with any 35-45k phone. Comparatively bigger than the Redmi note 8. Feels decently sturdy build wise and the back cover is worth the look. The 64MP camera along with the other ones put up a good show of details, very steady shots(highly commendable). Quite lite in weight too and smooth software performance. I recon its the best buy right now, totally worth the price. Be prepared for shockingly quick lightening fast delivery.</span>",

Prem pandey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste money on this phone üò°,Reviewed in India on 9 May 2020,"<span>The man takes the phone first looks good and calling , mail , message, camera and others features , which I'll will give a rating of thi phone cin  2 stars because it has to search the network again and again, there is a lot of problem in calling. On its side comes the other company's mobile same  sim company's good network and calling. In Redme 8 pro Its voice also does not equal in the free hand. Pressing the phone on the ear on its normal mode at the time of calling. 128 GB of good storage in this phone. 6 GB RAM is also good.  In advertising by the company have shown  inbuilt Alexa app that I had run this mobile well but after 3 weeks setting problem . Having seen two to three months, which means that it only takes so much money by showing only storage and RAM, but mobile and calling all settings are not that much  good.<br>I will never take this company's phone now because.</span>",

This review is after using 2 months of redmi note 8 pro.<br>I play pubg a lot, As goes on. Mobile gets heated pretty fast. It's not like i don't know how to care mobile. I do everything that can be done from cleaning ram to bosting every single time i get a chance. But Nah. It heats again.<br>About camera. I'm Not pro. But when someone says 64 MP, you don't need talent to get a good picture. Outside clarity is awesome but when u try to shoot any food. The color is bland. I've to retouch the color again from 3rd party apps.<br>TRemainoing everythis is fine. battery backup is fine.<br><br>1 more thing, It is not fast charging.

Fingerprint reader, Camera Quality all is top notch. However, battery could be a little bit better, but I cannot complain. However, like most of MI products, this phone also has a lot of bloatware as well. Do remove them if you don't need all of that. Phone heats a little bit, however it is not troublesome. Camera is really good in this price range and takes spectacular photos. A good phone at the price range.</span>",
Pramod sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's Aweeeeeeesoooooooomeeeeee!!!!! ¬°!!!!!!!!!!!!,Reviewed in India on 2 December 2019,"<span>Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:<br><br>6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB | 64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Camera<br><br>This is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there‚Äôs a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, battery<br><br>Games like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.<br><br>The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.<br><br>The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.<br><br>Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, Display<br><br>The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.<br><br>The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.<br><br>The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.</span>",

Mamta,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Video quality is not upto the mark, Screen rotate doesn't work properly.",Reviewed in India on 26 December 2019,"<span>It's been two weeks since m using this product, display quality is not upto the mark or as mentioned in the description. Also, camera quality is just ok. Screen rotate off doesn't work and you will have to shake mobile multiple times to get it your way. It's irritating sometimes. Blocking calls or messages doesn't help. Recognizing which sim you're using to call or receiving call from is difficult as operator names are not being displayed anywhere. Even the sim slots are not mentioned. Battery life is good. Screen resolution is not upto the mark. Brightness you will have to keep above 70% to make it visualize in a day light outside your home/office. M very upset with the video quality. Sound quality is ok but speaker is at the bottom facing downside so little difficult to keep the phone downside up all the time. Overall rating should be max 3 out of 5.</span>",

And they will also not be able to help and raise a replacement request rather scheduled a technician visit today 8th January, but it has been automatically changed to 11th January, and the return window closes on 10th January. Really confused and worried here without any support from Amazon. Shouldn't have brought this product from Amazon<br><br>Edit : Thanks to Sunil support executive, who understands customer.</span>",

Can handle basically any game and few large apps at a time. I haven't played much games thou<br><br>4.) MIUI !!! ads can be disabled and nobody uses mi browser or bloat apps anyway.<br><br>5.)

So, this is my complete review of the phone:<br><br>PERFORMANCE: I installed PUBG Mobile in it, and by default, it was set to high graphics, as recommended. I ran the game in HDR + Ultra, and the game ran as smooth as butter. On Antutu, this phone scored 284973, which is actually the score of iPhone X. I was literally shocked, when I saw this score.<br><br>CAMERA: The groundbreaking 64MP camera did an unbelievably good work. It can shoot videos upto 1080p 60fps and 4K 30 fps, and slow motion videos at 720p 960fps. The 20MP selfie camera did its job pretty well, taking some natural pictures in both indoor and outdoor conditions.<br><br>LOOKS: The phone looks as beautiful as hell! The glass back just magnifies its beauty to an another level. The Phone is also protected by Gorilla Glass 5, on both the front and the back.<br><br>BATTERY: The phone gives the battery life of flagships. While fully charged, you can watch YouTube for 10 hours at 10% brightness. Also, the 18W fast charger provided in the box charges it from 0-90 within 1 hour 30 mins, regardless of having a 4500 mAh battery.<br><br>OTHER FEATURES: The MIUI 10 with Android 9.0 Pie provided out-of-the-box is well optimised for this device. It comes with a system-wide dark mode, that increase its battery life, by reducing battery usage. The speakers are actually very loud. The P2i coating protects the phone against water splashes. It also has a dedicated microSD Card slot. The IR blaster present in it makes it extremely good. Also, Xiaomi has also announced that they would be providing Android 10 (MIUI 11) by December 25 via OTA.<br><br>Encompassing all this features, Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is the best Mid-Ranger in this price segment. I would recommend you to checkout this phone before buying any other device under 15-18K</span>",

Mukesh Murugan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love IT!,Reviewed in India on 22 November 2019,"<span>Bought the 6GB/128GB Shadow Black Variant on 13/November. Got it delivered within a week. Firstly not a very good packaging via Amazon.<br>Now for the Device, I am upgrading from a Note 6 Pro to Note 8 Pro.Great First Impressions.Have been using it to the maximum.Gaming Experience is too good. Overheating issues? Not much that would make me stop Gaming.<br><br>Detailed Review.<br>Display - Picture Perfect. Watching 4k 60fps on this Beast is mind-blowing.Screen Brightness is somewhat low compared to my previous device. 9/10<br><br>Build Quality - Top Grade Build with Premium Feel.For this price range, MI has done a brilliant work.<br><br>RAM - Great RAM Management. Have Used a maximum of 4.5GB at a moment running multiple Games parallely. 9/10<br><br>MIUI - Buttery Smooth Interface. Ads are a bit irritating once in a while, but there are ways to completely disable MI ads via some tweaks.Have received Miui11 Update based on Android 9. Android 10 expected by mid December. 9/10<br><br>Battery - Not very impressed. With an above average usage and frequent short phase gaming, I am able to get a battery backup of about 1 day max. 7/10<br><br>Camera - Nothing very impressive as the ""World's First 64MP Quad Camera"" Tag suggested. MI is doing quite a lot of image processing which is clearly visible. Selfies at times give brushed finishes.Its just an above average Sensor. Software Update would make the images better. Let's wait. 7/10<br><br>Gaming - This is what the phone is meant for. Supreme Gaming Experience. Near to Desktop Gaming Experience. Asphalt Legends at max settings runs butter smooth. COD does a great job as well at max settings.<br><br>I got this device for 15,999 INR. DO Not OVERTHINK. This is the best deal you could ever get.</span>",

Fingerprint reader is too good and response very fast. Then camera under this price is extremely remarkable and 64 x zoom factor will give very fine detail so it's good. Now talk about the battery, it's been more than a month when I bought this phone and battery life is great and it hardly take 1.25 hr approx to charge 100% and run more than 1 day without charge so battery is strong.

Night photography in PRO mode is excellent. Charging time is less than average. Display is average.<br>Overall this can be a good camera phone and if you play PUBG in ULTRA HDR / FREE FIRE in ULTRA, You can see some frame drops.<br>This can be a good budget smart phone for it's camera and ALEXA built in.

Rahul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Midrange smartphone for gaming,Reviewed in India on 24 December 2019,"<span>Performance :- When it comes to performance with G90T they just killer every mid range phone in terms of performance it's better then Snapdragon 712,730 and equal or better then 730G.When I play pubg in HDR ULTRA I realise I have made the best decision  CAMERA:- The quality and clearity of its camera is awesome, In day light it capture every detail (Har deetail note kiya jaye ) But XT performances better their but In low light condition Clearly Note 8 Pro is winner and the macro camera just zoom till 2cm and the picture  comes with great details and looks awesome.  BATTERY:- 4500 MAH battery works definately great but an IPS LCD pannel don't save battery  BUILD QUALITY :- It comes with glass body which feel premium in hands and looks beautiful It is one of the best phone in mid range segment in build quality  CONS:- 1) Consume more power during playing games because the processor is build in 12nm technology  2)They should provide Super amoled in this price range.</span>",

Ajithkumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Especially for Redmi Lovers,Reviewed in India on 6 December 2019,"<span>Nowadays, Redmi is the brand which sets a benchmark for other brands in this crowded lower midrange phones. These benchmarks are highly competant to other OEMs. The Helio G90T is a fantastic Gaming chip which supports full capabilities in any mode. The gameplay is buttery smooth, and sustained higher frame rates, liquid cooling all are clearly helping for good gaming experience. Redmi showed that, just we don't need a gamecentric phones which 2x or 3x more expensive. The only thing scratching my head is, when they gonna give a AMOLED display in this segment. MI A3 is good phone but it's not well rounded. Note 8 pro is a good phone who are seeking it for games, bcoz everyone now asking is this phone good for PUBG, bcoz smooth gameplay refers to a good GPU. The GPU in Note 8 pro is an odd pearl in the midrange segment. Thats it!.</span>",

The phone built quality is really good! ‚úîÔ∏è<br>I use OnePlus 7 as my daily driver and I have no issues with built quality of this phone ‚úîÔ∏è<br><br>2. I don't like MI UI much ‚ùå so I installed Poco Launcher and use one UI icon pack from playstore to give the phone a nice feel. ‚úîÔ∏è<br><br>3. Moving on to display, there is no need to worry. It's an IPS display but does the job well ‚úîÔ∏è No complains here. ‚úîÔ∏è<br><br>4. Camera performance can be subjective -  I have attached pictures of a plant taken by all lenses (main, telephoto, ultrawide and macro) + a portrait shot also. Overall camera - 4/5 ‚≠ê<br><br>5. I experienced no issues with Alexa app so far. Some reviewers had mentioned some problems but I didn't experience any. ‚úîÔ∏è<br><br>6. Change the haptic motor / feedback settings to light and it will be good. It comes at medium settings by default which doesn't feel that good.<br><br>Overall great value for money ( easy 4.5+/5 ) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  #Highly Recommended</span>",

Battery life is also very good. You can easily get 1 and half days battery. Charging speed is pretty decent. Fingerprint reader is very fast and accurate. Display is HDr supported. Performance is top notch. I have not noticed any lag or frame drops and multitasking is really smooth. Call quality and network reception is also good. The only con that I have noticed is during youtube video play colours sometimes appears odd. Hope it will be fixed very soon by software updates. Overall the phone is best in this price and it's more than value for money product. Don't be tensed, just go for it.</span>",

Joy,4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT,Reviewed in India on 3 January 2020,"<span>¬π¬∞CAMERA was the main focus of the particular smartphone. It hosts a 64 MP MAIN CAMERA with 3 other rear cameras and a 20 MP front shooter. It does a phenomenal job while clicking photos  (I have added some sample shots. You will notice that I removed the watermark option in some of the photos). Although the Night Mode sucks , one of the worst that's why I reduced 1 star. But in daylight it does a fabulous job<br><br>¬≤¬∞DISPLAY was an issue . I believe that if it was an LED screen it would have been  so much better. But the LCD panel does a fairly good job.<br>Thanks to the large display.<br><br>¬≥¬∞PROCESSOR should be no problem for you people . I don't play games so I don't know about it's gaming capabilities. Everyday task works smoothly .üëç<br><br>‚Å¥¬∞BATTERY is fairly large and it lasts a day for me . Again I would say that I don't play games so I don't know about the battery capabilities under heavy usages. The 18 W charger does a good job but I wish it was a 27 W or the new 33 W charger.<br><br>‚Åµ¬∞ OTHER HIGHLIGHTS---  The in hand feel is really great , I don't use the case so it's not that heavy . But if u use a case it is really heavy to use while laying down and when using single handedly. Speaker is not that loud.<br><br>YEAH THAT'S ALL.HOPE I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU.</span>",

Even when you open the camera on the lock screen mode when you swipe to left it  it takes time to open the camera.

Prateek Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beast of the budget segment,Reviewed in India on 22 November 2019,<span>I have been using this phone since nearly 9 days now and i can assure everyone who is thinking of buying it to go for it. Yes the other brands give samoled display for the same price range but the processor this phone has is just awesome and the camera at the rear is super cool. I am a pubg player and it heats up normally as every other phone nothing above than that. It gives hdr plus ultra frames which is pretty awesome for a phone at this price range and i have attached some camera samples and nothing has been changed excpet some vignette that i added and the camera wins my heart everytime the outdoor photos are just excellent. And night mode is par excellence. The battery runs very easily for a day if used lightly and needs a charge in the evening after playing for nearly 2 hours of pubg. In love with this phone can't say anything other than just go for it! No questions to be askedüòÅ</span>,

krishnajith,4.0 out of 5 stars,Performance beast not a camera beast,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2019,"<span>The 64mp sensor is outstanding but the 16mp normal camera is over sharpening the image in some cases. Portrait mode is awesome but the dedicated night mode is an absolute failure too much noise. The normal mode works better than the night mode. Performance-wise its a beast with awesome battery backup. Normal use will last up to 3 days. For heavy use, it will last a full day. Gaming - no issues it can play almost every high-end games.  MediaTek Helio g90t - Absolute beast, no heating issues. The only problem I found with the Redmi note 8 pro is the imperfection in the image processing. I think this happens only with the Indian variant. It has great hardware. I am hoping that the image processing issues will be fixed with an update...And the gamma green is a very sexy color.</span>",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sometimes lags otherwise fine,Reviewed in India on 12 June 2020,<span>Though the phone runs smoothly sometimes the back button doesnt respond. Feels like hanging. You have to run mobile cleaner app frequently to get smooth performance. Size of the phone is quite large. When I was watching movie in  NETFLIX touching the screen was not responding. I dont play game but use internet heavily. My battery goes for 1and half days after full charge. Taking selfi using finger print touch pad is not available. Before my redmi note 3 has this feature. Others things are very good. I bought paying 16k now the price increased to 17k for 6gb 128 gb specification.</span>,
Elias hassan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wasted üò≠üò≠,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2020,<span>To be honest. I'm a Redmi note 8 pro user. It gets its power from Helio G90T. Which I expected will fulfill my expectations. But it failed. Yeah it was good when fresh and new. But after one month I have more than 50GB storage left but still lags on pubg. I m a small youtuber. This is not my channel it's my private account. But I m facing a lot more issue with the phone. I belong to a middle class family. And I take this smartphone instead of taking a 30k one. Just thought that it will but it's failing. I'm depressed now. Xiaomi broke me. I thought that it will compete sd845 but I was wrong. üò≠üò≠ Wasted 16000 rupees.

So Personally after usage of 3 days i am Satisfied For Gaming , streaming videos,Its  Monster.About The Fingerprint Scanner Its Awesome and Fastly recognizes About The camera section good. Coming to the battery section 4500mah battery Here we can watch 4 to 5 movies of 2hours and gaming we can continuously play for 5 to 6 hours continously and also has a great standby .The only thing i was<br>disappointed was the transparent case which was included in the box was not protected for Camera hump and also there was no headset so that was a bit disappointment. So Go for it.</span>",

The camera I was very excited about but a) it automatically beautifies and in app cameras don't click good pics, usually my WhatsApp pictures are pixelated like there's smudge on the camera. The finger print sensor is nice and easy to configure. I do not play any games which I understand is a crime with a powerful phone like this.

You get what you pay for and more. If your confused between the 8 pro and 9 pro, go for this. The 9 isn't a successor in terms of proformance, only aces aesthetically.

Ramjith,5.0 out of 5 stars,most high performance midrange phone,Reviewed in India on 13 June 2020,"<span>The Redmi Note series has become ubiquitous to high performance and good cameras, all under Rs 15,000. While there‚Äôs no telling if this price barrier will be breached next time, Xiaomi managed to pack in even more fire power and four cameras with the new Note 8 Pro without increasing the price of the entry variant. It‚Äôs the second Redmi Note Pro smartphone to launch in 2019 in India. If Realme and Samsung indeed put a dent in Xiaomi‚Äôs top spot in the Indian market, the Note 8 Pro is the company‚Äôs answer to snatch it back. But with so many options now in the mid-range segment, is the Redmi Note 8 Pro the best mid-range smartphone to buy right now</span>",

I didn't try with other wifi or other redmi phone. Its what I felt. I don't know the problem is in my wifi or my set or overall Redmi note 8pro sets.

Video playback quality is worst, as of now user interface and response is good but only thing is display it's very bright in sight you feel like first generation screen (like early 60's) . You pretty much start hating YouTube because of worst display. Other than that phone is good and responsive but I think display is most important part of any mobile phone so you make sure what you are looking in your phone, if it is for viewing video using games this phone is not for you go for any other phones in any other brand</span>",

Prasenjit Das,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Camera,Reviewed in India on 12 February 2020,"<span>Received a fused red pixel one, but it's not making any difference, otherwise overall at this price very nice set, camera specially 64MP great in daylight, video recording was super, the rest 2 camera ultra wide and macro is not up to mark, I think they captured pic like 2010-11 era camera, the main sensor great, selfie camera is also very good. Although screen is not amoled but it's create very sharp and saturated image, if u like photography then go for it, but u need good light for best and detailed photos.</span>",

Samuel l.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for price,Reviewed in India on 5 March 2020,"<span>After using 2 weeks i would like to place a review. This redmi note 8 pro is one of the best you could find in the price range, especially with the processor. Playing online game or any other big game, you wont feel any lag.  The pro with liquid cooling technology also play a great role.<br>Camera: dont expect to be a DSLR camera, for a phone camera it really work perfect. Its battery little drain fast campare to that of samsung m30 i.e 6K mAh, but the fast charging is ok. If anyone tying to buy a phone of mid-range u should go for it. Its a reasonably price. But, Redmi should improve its display like Samsung AMOLED.</span>",

Battery is good enough for a day use. Camera is made for the pro users. The pictures I have shared are clicked in pro mode. You may go with the phone if you are not a phone addict and have minimum usage.</span>,

Salman khan,5.0 out of 5 stars,All Good,Reviewed in India on 10 December 2019,"<span>I purchased this brand because after several people from Europe recommended it. Since I travel overseas, I needed 2 sim cards slots, good bettery, higher ram and internal space. All of this is included in most phones, but price is not. For a fraction of the cost, I got more then expected. It took me a bit to modify everything to my needs. Thing like dark mode is a huge thing for me. Cameras are pretty good too. Especially wide mode. Also was happy to find reading mode that blocks blue light spectrum. Charging speed is very good too. In 4g I get all bars despite B&amp;H compatibility tool told me 3 bars for US ATT network, I took the chance and no regrets yet.</span>",

If your a camera or videography person then I'll recommend realme XT because amoled display. Overall camera quality is same.</span>,

However the replaced phone had same issue. I therefore requested for refund and taking back the phone. Amazon is kind enough to arrange for pick up of phone next day and thereafter i will get refund. In my opinion, Redmi has kept fm radio just for the sake of impressing specifications. Redme should either drop the tool or check its performance before releasing the model. Incidentally my lenovo. K3 note a 5 year old phone still plays very good on. Fm radio!</span>",

Chetan choudhary,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review after 2 months use.,Reviewed in India on 7 March 2020,"<span>Performance is excellent. Touch and fingerprint sensor is also up to the mark. Sound quality is good. Camera quality is not at all to the mark as presented by company. The pics are blur and it is not acceptable when you have a so called 64 MP camera.<br><br>Vidoes are much better than photos. Also slow motion feature is great.<br><br>Overall it is a great phone, but purchasing 8GB ram varient is not required. J have 8GB ram varient and so I felt that there is no such difference in performance as compared to a 6GB ram varient.</span>",

The phone gets heated too much, which is unusual. 4500 MaH battery they said but I find it similar to 4000 MaH battery of Note 5 pro. The third drawback is the camera and screen clarity. When compared to my previous handset (Note 5 pro), Note 8 Pro doesn't give the good screen and front camera clarity.<br>Not that happy with the phone! Le liya to chalana padhega!</span>",

Mohammed moiz Ahmed,2.0 out of 5 stars,Video quality not good for apps like YouTube.,Reviewed in India on 16 March 2020,"<span>This phone is best for gamers, the video playing quality is not good. You have play videos in YouTube at 720 quality. Other wise . it will be worse to see at 360 quality,my mobile data expires maximum for watching YouTube . It's the biggest negativity about this phone. Other brand phones give you great picture quality.</span>",
